+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPA is now installed, and sample configuration files were created in
${SYMPA_HOME}${SYSCONFDIR}/sympa.conf and ${SYMPA_HOME}${SYSCONFDIR}/wwsympa.conf

Basic configuration
===================

You should first edit them to suit your needs, at least http_host,
domain, listmaster, db_type, db_host, db_user, db_passwd, wwsympa_url
settings in ${SYMPA_HOME}${SYSCONFDIR}/sympa.conf, and then configure the needed
database with one of the ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/sympa/create_db.*
provided schemas.
You should also install the corresponding p5-DBD-{mysql,SQLite,Pg} module.
Moreover, p5-ldap package is needed if you plan to use LDAP features
and p5-SOAP-Lite package is needed if you plan to use sympa_soap_server.

WWSympa configuration
=====================

To enable WWSympa within Apache once wwsympa.fcgi has been spawned,
please create a symbolic link from /var/www/conf/modules.sample/sympa.conf
to /var/www/conf/modules/sympa.conf

# ln -s /var/www/conf/modules.sample/sympa.conf \
        /var/www/conf/modules
# apachectl stop
# apachectl start

WWSympa should be available at http://domain.tld/sympa/

Startup/Shutdown configuration
==============================

You can control sympa/wwsympa.fcgi daemons using the rc scripts in
${RCDIR}.

Mail aliases configuration
==========================

Add systemwide robot aliases to your aliases file:

sympa: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue sympa@domain.tld"
listmaster: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue listmaster@domain.tld"
bounce+*: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue sympa@domain.tld"
abuse-feedback-report: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue sympa@domain.tld"
sympa-request: postmaster
sympa-owner: postmaster

if you're using sendmail, you should declare ${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases
as an additional alias file in your sendmail.mc :

define(`ALIAS_FILE', `/etc/mail/aliases,${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases')dnl

If you're using postfix, edit main.cf and set :

alias_database = hash:/etc/mail/aliases, hash:${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases
alias_maps = hash:/etc/mail/aliases, hash:${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases

Security considerations
=======================

Note that the following binaries are installed with particular modes/owner/group :
- the following are 4755 _sympa:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/familyqueue
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue
- the following are 6755 _sympa:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/sympa_soap_server-wrapper.fcgi
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi
- the following is 4750 root:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/sympa_newaliases-wrapper

For the various set-uid sympa wrappers to work fine, you have to make
sure ${SYMPA_HOME} is in a partition mounted without nosuid.

Now refer to http://www.sympa.org/manual/index for more information.
