This module analyzes mail objects in any of the classes handled by
Email::Abstract. It returns a Mail::ListDetector::List object
representing the mailing list.

The RFC2369 mailing list detector is also capable of matching some
Mailman and Ezmlm messages. It is deliberately checked last to allow
the more specific Mailman and Ezmlm parsing to happen first, and
more accurately identify the type of mailing list involved.
