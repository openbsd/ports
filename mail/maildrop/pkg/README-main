| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maildrop must be run as the uid/gid of the user whose mailbox it is
delivering to.

Therefore, if the MTA does not spawn it with the correct uid/gid, it
needs to be suid root to perform the operation itself.

The port is installed with the suid bit stripped by default. This works
out-of-the-box with MTAs like qmail, which spawn maildrop with the
correct uid/gid it needs to perform the delivery.

For more information, please read the documentation in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/maildrop/INSTALL.
It should be safe to enable the suid bits, but scan over the code first
and satisfy yourself that there are no security holes.

If you perform a full audit, please inform <ports@openbsd.org> and the
suid bit may then be enabled by default.

The following files will need suid re-enabled if you so choose:
	${PREFIX}/bin/maildrop
	${PREFIX}/bin/lockmail
