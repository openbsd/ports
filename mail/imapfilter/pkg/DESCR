IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility.  It connects to remote mail
servers using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends
searching queries to the server and processes mailboxes based on the
results.  It can be used to delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages
residing in mailboxes at the same or different mail servers.  The 4rev1
and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are supported.

IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and
extension language.
