<p><b>Usage:</b><br>

You can use spamassassin in many ways. But the lightest for the machine is by
making use of the spamc/spamd combination.

<p>First let's add a user for the spamd.

<pre><b># useradd -s /usr/bin/false -b /nonexistent spamdaemon</b></pre>

<p>Add this line to <b><code>/etc/rc.local</b></code>:
<pre><b># /usr/local/bin/spamd -u spamdaemon -d -L -p 4321 -x</b></pre>
<br> Use that same line to start spamd now.

<p>The final step: put this at the top of your <b><code>.procmailrc</b></code>.
If you have chosen not to use procmail please check the
 <A HREF="http://spamassassin.org/doc.html">online docs</A>

<ul><pre>
:0fw
| spamc -p 4321 -f

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.</pre></ul>

<p><b>Customizing:</b><br>

The spam filtering is not perfect. But since the feedback is very extensive you
should be able to do what is necessary to get most spam filtered. 

<p>The configuration file is<code><b> /etc/spamassassin/local.cf
</b></code>and all options are described in:<code><b> man
Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf</b></code>
