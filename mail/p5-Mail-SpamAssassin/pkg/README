| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

This is just a mini-README to get you up and running if you are in a
hurry. Please go to http://spamassassin.apache.org/ for further information.

Configuration
=============
You can use spamassassin in many ways. Larger installations might use
it in combination with smtp-vilter, MailScanner or amavisd-new (all are
available in packages). A common method for a simple setup is to use
the spamc/spamd combination with procmail. To configure this, add
"spamassassin" to your "pkg_scripts" line in /etc/rc.conf.local.

(Use "${RCDIR}/spamassassin start" to start the daemon right away).

The final step: put this at the top of your .procmailrc.

* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.

If you do not want to use procmail, please check the online docs at
http://spamassassin.apache.org/doc.html and the documentation for any
other software you use to implement spamassassin (MailScanner, etc).


Customizing
===========
The spam filtering is not perfect. But since the feedback is very
extensive you should be able to do what is necessary to get most spam
filtered.

If you want to add custom settings to spamassassin you can create the
file ${SYSCONFDIR}/mail/spamassassin/local.cf . All possible options
are described in: man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf
