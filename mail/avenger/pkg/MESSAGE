You must configure Mail Avenger before running it:

  - Edit the ${SYSCONFDIR}/avenger/asmtpd.conf file for your system.

  - If you don't run sendmail, edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/avenger/unknown.

  - See ${SYSCONFDIR}/avenger/smtp-filter if you want Mail Avenger to take
    advantage of OpenBSD's pf packet filter.
