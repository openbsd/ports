DSPAM is an open-source, freely available anti-spam solution designed to 
combat unsolicited commercial email using advanced statistical analysis. 
In short, DSPAM filters spam by learning what spam is and isn't by 
learning each user's individual mail behavior. This allows DSPAM to 
provide highly-accurate, personalized filtering for each user on even a 
large system and provides an administratively maintenance free solution 
capable of learning each user's email behaviors with very few false 
positives.

Available flavors are:

- clamav: enable usage of the clam antivirus.

- ldap: include support for LDAP verification.
