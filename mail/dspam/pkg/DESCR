DSPAM is an open-source, freely available anti-spam solution designed to 
combat unsolicited commercial email using advanced statistical analysis. 
In short, DSPAM filters spam by learning what spam is and isn't by 
learning each user's individual mail behavior. This allows DSPAM to 
provide highly-accurate, personalized filtering for each user on even a 
large system and provides an administratively maintenance free solution 
capable of learning each user's email behaviors with very few false 
positives.

Available flavors are:

- daemon: add the ability to run dspam as multiple clients connecting to a
central server. This flavor is required in order to use the --daemon and
--client command-line switches. However, the daemon mode is currently
incompatible with sqlite.

- clamav: enable usage of the clam antivirus.

- ldap: include support for LDAP verification.

- sqlite: use the sqlite 2.x library as a storage engine.

- sqlite3: use the sqlite 3.x library as a storage engine. This is the
default.

- pgsql: use a posgresql server as a storage engine.

- mysql: use a mysql server as a storage engine.

- hash: use the CRM Sparse Spectra (CSS) storage engine.
