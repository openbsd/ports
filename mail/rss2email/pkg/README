Migrating from rss2email 2
==========================
rss2email 3 uses a different config and data format from previous versions.

Hopefully you read the OpenBSD upgrade instructions before updating the
package and have saved the old feed list with "r2e opmlexport > ~/r2e.opml".
Also save the output of "r2e list" if you have any feeds sending to a
non-default email address.

After updating, create a new feed database, set the default email address
and import saved feeds:

    r2e new
    r2e email defaultaddress@example.com
    cat ~/r2e.opml | r2e opmlimport

For any feeds with a non-default email address, delete and re-add with the
correct address. Adjust other config in ~/.config/rss2email.cfg as needed
based on the old settings in ~/.rss2email/config.py.

The "last read" information is not transferred. If you don't want to re-send
old messages (and don't mind missing any new messages since the last run with
the old version), you can skip sending mail for the first run:

    r2e run --no-send

Alternatively use "r2e run" as usual if you want to be sure to avoid missing
anything.

The new feed data is stored in ~/.local/share/rss2email.json.
