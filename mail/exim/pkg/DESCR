Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge
for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is freely available
under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In overall style it is
similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are more extensive. It contains
facilities for verifying incoming sender and recipient addresses, for refusing
mail from specified hosts, networks, or senders, and for controlling mail
relaying. This version also supports the STARTTLS extension.

This port can be built with the following flavors:

no_x11 - do not build eximon which requires X11
no_perl - do not include perl support
no_tls - do not include SSL/TLS support
mysql - support mysql queries for lookups
pgsql - support pgsql queries for lookups
ldap - support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups

All these flavors are independent of each other.
