==============================================================
Example configuration files for Courier-IMAP have been installed
in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/courier-imap.

You should copy imapd.config, imapd-ssl.config and imapd.cnf
to /etc, and edit them to your site's needs.  Pay particular
attention to the details in imapd.cnf, and read ssl(8) if
necessary.  You MUST set the CN in imapd.cnf to the hostname
by which your imap server is accessed, or else clients will
throw up security warnings.

When this is done, you can use the 'mkimapdcert' script
to automatically generate a server certificate, which 
is installed into /etc/ssl/private/imapd.pem

It is generally not a good idea to expose plain-text IMAP to
the outside world, so you can bind the plain-text one to 
127.0.0.1, and the SSL one to your external IP interface(s).

To control the daemon use ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd.rc and
${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd-ssl.rc

If you also installed the 'pop3' flavor, then the relevant
configuration files are called pop3d-* instead of imapd-*
Follow similar instructions to those above to activate this.
