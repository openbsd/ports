==============================================================
Example config files for Courier-IMAP have been installed
in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/courier-imap.

Copy all of the files to ${COURIERCONF} and 
edit them to your site's needs.  Pay particular attention to 
the details in imapd.cnf, and read ssl(8) if necessary.
You MUST set the CN in imapd.cnf to the hostname by which 
your IMAP server is accessed, or else clients will complain.

When this is done, you can use the 'mkimapdcert' script
to automatically generate a server certificate, which 
is installed into /etc/ssl/private/imapd.pem

To control the daemon use ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd.rc and
${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd-ssl.rc, and to run the authdaemon,
place the following in /etc/rc.local:

mkdir -p ${COURIERSTATE} 
${PREFIX}/libexec/authlib/authdaemond start

If you also installed the 'pop3' flavor, then the relevant
configuration files are called pop3d-* instead of imapd-*
Follow similar instructions to those above to activate this.
