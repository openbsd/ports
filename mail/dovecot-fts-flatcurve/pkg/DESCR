This is a Dovecot FTS plugin to enable message indexing using the
Xapian search engine library. It is intended to act as a simple
interface to the Xapian storage/search query functionality.

Unlike the other Xapian-based FTS plugin "dovecot-fts-xapian",
flatcurve relies on Dovecot to do the necessary stemming, and supports
match scoring and substring matches - it is RFC 3501 (IMAP4rev1)
compliant. It does not support fuzzy searches.
