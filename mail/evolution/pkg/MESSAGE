Please note: If you intend to use Evolution to read local mail-spool
mbox files then you will need to set the setuid bit for the
camel-lock-helper program.

You can do this by: 'chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/sbin/camel-lock-helper'

While there are no known security problems at this time with
camel-lock-helper, setting the setuid bit on any program is a
potential security risk.
