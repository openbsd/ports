Evolution, by Ximian Inc., integrates email, calendaring, meeting
scheduling, contact management and online task lists into one
application.

Evolution supports a number of communication standards including
SMTP, SMTP/Authorized, POP, IMAP, Kerberos and others. Peer-to-peer
calendaring is also supported with products that support iCalendar
such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes.  Evolution can also
import mailboxes created with Netscape, Outlook Express, UNIX mbox,
Eudora and other email managers.

The ldap flavor adds support for using LDAP to access corporate
address books and address servers.

Note: Evolution might fail due to a lack of shared memory.  The
simplest workaround is to run Evolution with the --no-xshm flag.
Alternatively, MIT-SHM shared memory use by imlib can be disabled
by turning it off in imlib_config and if necesary you can disable
XFree86 "big font" support to free up additional shared memory by
setting the XF86BIGFONT_DISABLE environment variable.

The shared memory limits can, of course, be globally set in the
kernel via the config(8) command as well.
