+---------------
| You'll have to edit /etc/inetd.conf manually and add 
| lines like the following:
|
|   pop3 stream tcp  nowait root ${PREFIX}/sbin/spop3d spop3d
|   pop3 stream tcp6 nowait root ${PREFIX}/sbin/spop3d spop3d
|
| The second line is only necessary if you want to use IPv6
| support.
|
| An optional global configuration file may be used in ${SYSCONFDIR}
| called spop3d.conf.
|
| See spop3d(8) and spop3d.conf(5) for available options.
