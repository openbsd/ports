The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  pop2    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
  pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/imapd    imapd


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf.

  pop3s   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imaps   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/imapd    imapd

You also need to install files containing an RSA certificate and private key
to /etc/ssl/ipop3d.pem and /etc/ssl/imapd.pem. See ssl(8) for how to do this.
