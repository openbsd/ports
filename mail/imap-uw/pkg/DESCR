This is the IMAP4rev1 server from the University of Washington.
Included are backwards-compatible (almost) POP2 and POP3 servers.

        ipop2d           POP2 daemon
        ipop3d           POP3 daemon
        imapd            IMAP4rev1 daemon


The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  pop2    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
  pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/imapd    imapd


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf. You also need to install files containing certificate
and private key to /etc/ssl/ipop3d.pem and /etc/ssl/imapd.pem.

  pop3s   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imaps   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/imapd    imapd

The following lines also needs to be added to /etc/services:

  imaps  993/tcp
  pop3s  995/tcp
