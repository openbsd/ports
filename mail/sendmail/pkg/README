Using sendmail as the default mailer.
=====================================

Deactivate smtpd
----------------
Running smtpd(8) and sendmail at the same time is not supported.  See
rc.d(8) for how to disable smtpd(8).

Tweaking /etc/mailer.conf
-------------------------
Two scripts are provided along with this package.  Run sendmail-enable
to adjust your mailer.conf(5), and sendmail-disable to revert your
changes.

Client mail queue ownership
---------------------------
This package ensures that /var/spool/clientmqueue is owned by
_smmsp:_smmsp, mode 0770.  You should verify that your submit.cf
configuration is not using the default settings (smmsp:smmsp).

Activate the queue runner
-------------------------
To process the mails in /var/spool/clientmqueue, the following entry
should be added to root's crontab(5):

*/30 * * * * ${PREFIX}/libexec/sendmail/sendmail -L sm-msp-queue -Ac -q

This will start the queue runner every 30 minutes.  Adjust according to
your needs.

Enable sendmail at startup time
-------------------------------
Remember to add sendmail to pkg_scripts.
Suggested daemon flags for a basic, localhost-only setup:

sendmail_flags="-L sm-mta -C/etc/mail/localhost.cf -bd -q30m"
