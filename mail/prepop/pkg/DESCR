prepop is a simple "online" POP3 email client, very suitable for
dialups and other slow connections.  It lets you read the text/plain
part of your email messages without having to download those big
pesky attachments (over dialups this can sometimes take a long time
and during this time you often have no idea on how much data is
left to be transferred).  With prepop you can also see the size of
all the messages when listing them.  You can't reply to messages
since this was not what prepop was designed to do.  prepop was not
designed to be an alternative to your current email client.  It's
more of a complementing email client doing some of the things your
ordinary email client should have handled in the first place.
