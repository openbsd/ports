Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.
 
This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
 
Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari MiNT,
Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.
Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

WARNING: This is an unstable version.  Most functionality should work fine, but
in some cases it might crash or even destroy your work.

If you run into something that doesn't work, please try to figure out why, try
to solve it and send me a patch.  If you can't do that, at least let me know
exactly how to reproduce the problem.

More info about the new 6.2 features with ":help version6-2".

If you don't like the syntax of a command, the name of an option or how the new
features work, let's discuss this in the vim-dev maillist.
