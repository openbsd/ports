The elvis text editor is intended to be a modern replacement for the
classic ex/vi editor of unix fame.  It supports many new features,
including multiple edit buffers, multiple windows, multiple user
interfaces, and a variety of display modes including plain text, syntax
highlighting, hex dump, HTML and man page formatter.

Available flavors:
        no_x11  - build without X11 support
