GNU TeXmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing
platform with special features for scientists. The software aims
to provide a unified and user friendly framework for editing
structured documents with different types of content (text, graphics,
mathematics, interactive content, etc.). The rendering engine uses
high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce professionally
looking documents, which can either be printed out or presented
from a laptop.
