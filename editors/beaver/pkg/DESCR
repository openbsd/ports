Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR, for Linux and other Unices (and even
Windows); in other words, it's a text editor that is intended to be
light-weight, but full of useful features for programming, from editing
of web sites to C coding. It is based upon the GTK+ toolkit, supports
many languages through config files and offers functions such as
automatic indentation and completion or syntax highlighting. In fact, it
is 100% compatible with Ultraedit's wordfile.txt files, and has its own
mini macro language.
