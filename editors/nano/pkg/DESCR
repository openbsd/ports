Nano is a small and simple text editor for use on the terminal.
It copied the interface and key bindings of the Pico editor but
added several missing features: undo/redo, syntax highlighting,
line numbers, softwrapping, multiple buffers, search-and-replace
with regular expressions, and several other conveniences.
