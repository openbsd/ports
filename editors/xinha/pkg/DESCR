Xinha (pronounced like Xena, the Warrior Princess) is a powerful WYSIWYG
HTML editor component that works in Mozilla-based browsers as well as in
MS Internet Explorer. Its configurability and extensibility make it easy
to build just the right editor for multiple purposes, from a restricted
mini-editor for one database field to a full-fledged website editor.
