Installing modules
==================
XEmacs is pretty useless as-is.  It is just an engine.
You need to install modules to provide your users full functionality.
There are two methods to achieve this:

  1) Install the xemacs21-sumo package.  It contains all the 
     modules currently supported by the XEmacs team. It's fast, easy
     and your users won't ever bother you again about this. On the
     other hand the package is quite huge.

  2) You have to install by hand every XEmacs' modules as described
     in the XEmacs documentation. (Search for "packages" in the info
     tree.) There are a lot of interdependencies between XEmacs' modules
     and you may end up with everything installed just as method 1)
     would have (without the hassle).

Note: XEmacs modules are named "packages" by the XEmacs team, the term
      "module" is used here just to limit possible confusion with
      OpenBSD packages.
