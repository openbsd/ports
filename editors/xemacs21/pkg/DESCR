	${HOMEPAGE}

NOTE:
	This package contains the XEmacs engine.
	Every major functionnality of XEmacs is a separate module.
	A complete set of theses modules is bundled in the
	"xemacs21-sumo" package.

Flavors:
	mule 		- MUlti-Lingual Emacs
	wnn 		- input method (needs mule) [4]
	canna 		- another input method (needs mule) [4]
	compface	- support for XFaces (needs X11)
	jpeg		- support for JPEGs (needs X11)
	no_png		- disable support for PNGs [1] (needs X11)
	tiff		- support for TIFFs (needs X11)
	motif		- make use of Motif [2] (needs X11)
	no_x11		- disable X11 support
	clashdetect	- prevents multiple editing of the same file [3]
	gdbm		- support for GNU dbm

[1] NOT RECOMMENDED - XEmacs makes use of PNG files quite a lot.
[2] Works with LessTif and OpenMotif.
[3] Even if you don't use this flavor, XEmacs' uses a lesser efficient way
    to prevent this.  The method this flavor implements involves a world-
    writeable directory.
[4] XEmacs coredumps if the {canna,wnn} server is killed before it closes
    connection.
