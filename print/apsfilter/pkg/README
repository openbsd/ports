| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure the apsfilter package, you have to run

   ${SYSCONFDIR}/apsfilter/basedir/SETUP

as root.

Depending on your printer and what files you want to print,
apsfilter needs some software for conversion like ghostscript,
ImageMagick or teTeX. For details, see section 3.1 of
file ${PREFIX}/share/doc/apsfilter/handbook.html
