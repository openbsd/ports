Adding and/or configuring CUPS printers can be done with lpadmin(8), but
for a quick and easy (graphical) setup, after starting the CUPS daemon,
point your browser to:
    http://localhost:631

By default, CUPS only supports a handful amount of printers. There is a
good chance your printer is supported by the Foomatic framework in which
case the pkg-readmes documentation from the "foomatic-db-engine" package
will tell you how to add more drivers to the system.
Note that when using the CUPS cli tools or web interface, it is not
necessary to use foomatic-ppdfile(1) directly, CUPS will automatically
generate the required PPD file if the corresponding Foomatic DB is
installed.

To be able to use CUPS printers from GTK+3 applications, the gtk+3-cups
package needs to be installed.

USB
===
Since USB printing will be handled by libusb, you need to allow the
_cups user access to the corresponding USB endpoint. To do so, find
where your printer is attached to using `sudo usbdevs -vd` then change
the ownerships accordingly.

e.g.
Controller /dev/usb3:
addr 1: full speed, self powered, config 1, UHCI root hub(0x0000), Intel(0x8086), rev 1.00
  uhub3
 port 1 powered
 port 2 addr 2: full speed, self powered, config 1, USB MFP(0x082f), EPSON(0x04b8), rev 1.00, iSerialNumber L83010704250947490
   ugen0

$ sudo chown _cups /dev/ugen0.* /dev/usb3

The reason we are changing the user and not the group is that it will
allow for multi-function devices to work for both printing and scanning
(e.g. by being owned by _cups:_saned).

To preserve your changes after a system update, use rc.local(8).
e.g. for a multi-function printer/scanner add the following lines:
chown _cups:_saned /dev/ugen0.* /dev/usb1

Alternatively, hotplugd(8) attach/detach scripts can automate this.

*** WARNING ***
ulpt(4) needs to be disable in the kernel (see config(8)) or the printer
will not be available to libusb.

UPGRADING
=========
If you experience cups-driverd(8) crashes or printing issues after
upgrading, remove the old CUPS cache and restart cups(8):
    # rm /var/cache/cups/* 2>/dev/null
    # ${RCDIR}/cupsd restart
