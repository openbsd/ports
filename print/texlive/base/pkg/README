Texmf Subsets
=============

There are a number of texmf trees in the OpenBSD packages:

texmf-buildset:
  The smallest of the subsets. This is primarily for building OpenBSD
  ports (approx 100M).

texmf-minimal:
  A teTeX like tree, suitable for casual TeX users who do not need many
  extra macros or ConTeXt (approx 250MB).

texmf-full:
  Extra macros (approx 500MB).

texmf-context:
  Macros for the conTeXt typesetter (approx 10MB).

  This was separated because conTeXt maintains it's own hashes separate
  from that of libkpse. As 99% of users don't use this, these hashes are
  generated only when the conTeXt macros are installed.

texmf-doc:
  Documentation (approx 550MB).

  To take load off the OpenBSD mirrors this is only the documentation
  for the texmf-minimal and texmf-buildset trees. This should include
  documentation for the most popular packages.

All sizes are approximate compressed package sizes and the texmf package
contents do not overlap.

There is a *lot* of functionality in texmf-full, so before reporting
"missing" features, please try installing texmf-full first. Eg. xindy
requires texmf-full.

User Local Texmf Trees
======================

Individual users may override or add to the TeX class and style files
supplied by TeX Live by installing them into ~/texmf. There is no need
to run mktexlsr(1) for a texmf tree in a user's $HOME. You can test the
installation by searching for the files using kpsewhich(1). Eg:

% find $HOME/texmf
/home/edd/texmf
/home/edd/texmf/tex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty
% kpsewhich acronym.sty
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty

Other Misc. Notes
=================

Tlmgr
-----

The 'tlmgr' script is disabled in the OpenBSD package. If you were to use
tlmgr to alter/update your texmf, the package tools would become rather upset.

Soft Dependencies
-----------------

Some requirements of TeX Live were not included as dependencies to make the
package less bloated for people who don't need those features.

As far as I know:

 * asymptote is in ports: graphics/asymptote
 * TeX Works is editors/texworks
 * latexmk is textproc/latexmk
 * textproc/py-pygments is required for the minted package.
 * converters/unix2dos is needed for installfont-tl script
 * x11/tk/${MODTK_VERSION} is needed for epspdftk
 * lang/ruby/${MODRUBY_LIBREV} is needed for convbkmk, epspdf, and
   other stuff.
 * Some scripts need bash.

If you know more, please mail the package maintainer.

Notes for Developers
--------------------

 * If you have a port which needs TeX stuff at build time, then it should
   BUILD_DEPENDS upon texlive_base which in turn will pull in
   texlive_texmf-buildset.

 * If the buildset is missing something that your port needs to build, then
   you can depend temporarily upon texlive_texmf-minimal or texlive_texmf-full.
   If you have to do this, please send an email to MAINTAINER so that we can
   have the support you need added to the buildset texmf.

 * If a non-texlive port installs texmf files then they should be installed
   into share/texmf-local, NOT share/texmf or share/texmf-dist.

Have fun TeXing.
