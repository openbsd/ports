Texmf Subsets
=============

There are a number of texmf trees in the OpenBSD packages:

texmf-minimal:
  A teTeX like tree, suitable for casual TeX users who do not need many
  extra macros or ConTeXt (approx 324MB).

texmf-full:
  Extra macros (approx 191MB).

texmf-context:
  Macros for the conTeXt typesetter (approx 7MB).

  This was separated because conTeXt maintains it's own hashes separate
  from that of libkpse. As 99% of users don't use this, these hashes are
  generated only when the conTeXt macros are installed.

texmf-doc:
  Documentation for all of TeX Live (approx 890MB).

All sizes are approximate compressed package sizes and the texmf package
contents do not overlap.

There is a *lot* of functionality in texmf-full, so before reportng
"missing" features, please try installing texmf-full first. Eg. xindy
requires texmf-full.

User Local Texmf Trees
======================

Individual users may override or add to the TeX class and style files
supplied by TeX Live by installing them into ~/texmf. There is no need
to run mktexlsr(1) for a texmf tree in a user's $HOME. You can test the
installation by searching for the files using kpsewhich(1). Eg:

% find $HOME/texmf
/home/edd/texmf
/home/edd/texmf/tex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty
% kpsewhich acronym.sty
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty

Upgrade From TeX Live 2009
==========================

Due to inconsistencies in the legacy TeX Live 2009 package, if you
upgraded from TeX live 2009 (at some point in the past) you may see the
package tools complain about non-empty directories. This is harmless,
but can be silenced by (having backed up anything manually added to
texmfs) removing all TeX Live packages, then `rm -Rf /usr/local/share/texmf*`.
Now you can install afresh the new TeX Live packages.

Other Misc. Notes
=================

Gmverb
------

The gmverb package now works again, but requires xelatex.

Tlmgr
-----

The 'tlmgr' script is disabled in the OpenBSD package. If you were to use
tlmgr to alter/update your texmf, the package tools would become rather upset.

Soft Dependencies
-----------------

Some requirements of TeX Live were not included as dependencies to make the
package less bloated for people who don't need those features.

As far as I know:

 * asymptote is in ports: graphics/asymptote
 * TeX Works is editors/texworks
 * latex-mk is print/latex-mk
 * textproc/py-pygments is required for the minted package.

If you know more, please mail the package maintainer: <edd@openbsd.org>

Have fun TeXing.
