PDFlib is a library of C routines which allow you to programmatically
generate files in Adobe's Portable Document Format PDF. PDFlib acts as a
backend processor to your own programs. While you (the programmer) are
responsible for retrieving or maintaining the data to be processed, PDFlib
takes over the task of generating the PDF code which graphically
represents your data.
