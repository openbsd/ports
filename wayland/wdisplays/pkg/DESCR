wdisplays is a graphical application for configuring displays in Wayland
compositors. It should work in any compositor that implements the
wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 protocol. Compositors that are known
to support the protocol are Sway and Wayfire. The goal of this project
is to allow precise adjustment of display settings in kiosks, digital
signage, and other elaborate multi-monitor setups.
