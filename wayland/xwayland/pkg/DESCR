XWayland is a fully fledged X server implementation that act as a
proxy between X11 clients and a Wayland compositor. It runs as a
specialized Wayland client, while optionally using a set of XWayland
specific Wayland protocols for implementing certain functionality. The
Wayland compositor acts both as the Wayland display server XWayland
connects to, as well as the Window Manager.
