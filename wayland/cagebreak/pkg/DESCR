cagebreak is a slim, keyboard-controlled, tiling compositor for wayland
conceptually based on the X11 window manager ratpoison.  It allows for
the screen to be split into non-overlapping tiles and, in contrast to
the original ratpoison, has native support for multi-workspace
operation.  All interactions between the user and cagebreak are done via
the keyboard.
