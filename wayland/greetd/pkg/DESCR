greetd is a minimal and flexible login manager daemon that makes no
assumptions about what you want to launch.

Use gtkgreet or regreet frontends if you want a fully graphical login
manager.

If you can run it from your shell in a TTY, greetd can start it. If it
can be taught to speak a simple JSON-based IPC protocol, then it can be
a greeter.
