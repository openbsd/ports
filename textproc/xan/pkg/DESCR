xan is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files
directly from the shell.

It has been written in Rust to be as fast as possible, use as little
memory as possible, and can very easily handle large CSV files
(Gigabytes). It leverages a novel SIMD CSV parser and is also able
to parallelize some computations (through multithreading) to make
some tasks complete as fast as your computer can allow.

It can easily preview, filter, slice, aggregate, sort, join CSV
files, and exposes a large collection of composable commands that
can be chained together to perform a wide variety of typical tasks.
