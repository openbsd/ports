In brief, latexml is a program, written in Perl, that attempts to faithfully
mimic TeX’s behavior, but produces XML instead of dvi. The document model of
the target XML makes explicit the model implied by LaTeX. The processing and
model are both extensible; you can define the mapping between TeX constructs
and the XML fragments to be created. A postprocessor, latexmlpost converts this
XML into other formats such as HTML or XHTML, with options to convert the math
into MathML (currently only presentation) or images.
