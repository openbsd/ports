Latexmk is a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times
to resolve cross references, etc; it also runs auxiliary programs
(bibtex, makeindex if necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as
requested).
It has a number of other useful capabilities, for example to start a
previewer and then run latex whenever the source files are updated, so
that the previewer gives an up-to-date view of the document.
