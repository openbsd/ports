python package for parsing and building CSS

A fork of the cssutils project based on version 1.0.2. This fork
includes general bug fixes and extensions specific to editing and
working with ebooks.

The main python source code has been modified so that it will run
without further conversion on both Python >= 2.7 and Python 3.X
without any further modules required. All required modifications
are handled local to each file

For more information on usage, please see the cssutils documentation
