Aspell is an Open Source spell checker designed to eventually replace
Ispell.  Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up
with possible suggestions than Ispell does. In fact recent tests shows
that it even does better than Microsoft Word 97's spell checker or just
about any other spell checker I have seen. It also has support for
checking (La)TeX and Html files, and run time support for other non
English languages. Aspell also is a library however the recommend way to
use aspell is through the Pspell library as the actual interface to the
aspell library is constantly changing.

This package also contains the English dictionary.
