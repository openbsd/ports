Epydoc is a tool for generating API documentation for Python modules,
based on their docstrings. A lightweight markup language called
epytext can be used to format docstrings, and to add information about
specific fields, such as parameters and instance variables. Epydoc
also understands docstrings written in reStructuredText, Javadoc, and
plaintext.
