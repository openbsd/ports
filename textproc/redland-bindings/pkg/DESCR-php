Redland librdf is a library that provides a high-level interface
for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph
to be parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland
implements each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object
based API.

This package contains the PHP bindings for Redland.
