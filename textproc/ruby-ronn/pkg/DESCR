Ronn builds manuals. It converts simple, human readable textfiles to
roff for terminal display, and also to HTML for the web.

The source format includes all of Markdown but has a more rigid
structure and syntax extensions for features commonly found in manpages
(definition lists, link notation, etc.). The ronn-format(7) manual page
defines the format in detail.
