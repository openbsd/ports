MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics.
It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a
pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page
on screen.

MuPDF has a small footprint.  A binary that includes the standard Roman
fonts is only one megabyte.  A build with full CJK support (including an
Asian font) is approximately five megabytes.

MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the
toolkit provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures of the
PDF document.

Command line utilities are included:  pdfdraw, to render pages and output
PNM image files.  pdfshow, to print and examine the objects in a PDF file.
pdfclean, to decompress and pretty print the streams and objects in PDF
files and also to extract individual pages.  mu_pdfinfo, to display
information about objects.  pdfextract, to extract individual objects.
