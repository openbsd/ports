MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within
fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of
a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more.
It also reads OpenXPS documents.

We don't support interactive features such as form filling, javascript
and transitions. MuPDF is written modularly, so such features can be
added on by integrators if they so desire.

The mutool command line tool supports multiple arguments, including
"show" to print and examine objects in a PDF file, "clean" to decompress
and pretty-print the streams and objects in PDF files and also to
extract individual pages, "info" to display information about objects,
"extract" to extract individual objects, and "poster" to split a large
page into many tiles.

The mudraw command line tool renders pages and outputs PGM/PPM/PAM/PNG
image files.

Flavors:
	js - build with JavaScript support (using the MuJS interpreter)

Note that the js flavor also include the OpenGL-based renderer "mupdf-gl"
which has some dependencies on MuJS.
