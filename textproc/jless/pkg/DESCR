jless is a command-line viewer designed for reading, exploring, and
searching through JSON data. It also supports YAML.

jless will pretty print your files and apply syntax highlighting.
Use it when exploring external APIs, or debugging request payloads.

Expand and collapse Objects and Arrays to grasp the high- and low-level
structure of a document. jless has a large suite of vim-inspired
commands that make exploring data a breeze.

jless supports full text regular-expression based search. Quickly find
the data you're looking for in long String values, or jump between
values for the same Object key.
