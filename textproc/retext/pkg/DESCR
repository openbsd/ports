ReText is a simple but powerful editor for markup languages. It is based
on 'Markups', which supports Markdown, reStructuredText, Textile and
AsciiDoc. One can also add support for custom markups using Python
modules.

For a more powerful preview engine with JavaScript support, you can
"pkg_add py3-qt6webengine", this is not forced as a dependency as it's
only available on a couple of machine architectures.
