libgrapheme is an extremely simple C99 library providing utilities for
properly handling Unicode strings made up of user-perceived characters
('grapheme clusters') according to the Unicode standard. While providing
convenience functions to operate on UTF-8-encoded strings, you can also
use libgrapheme for any other encoding as well.
