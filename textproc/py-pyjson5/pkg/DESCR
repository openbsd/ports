JSON5 serializer and parser library for Python 3 written in Cython.

The serializer returns ASCII data that can safely be used in an HTML
template. Apostrophes, ampersands, greater-than, and less-then signs are
encoded as unicode escaped sequences.

Unless the input contains infinite or NaN values, the result will be
valid JSON data.

The parser can handle all valid JSON5 1.0.0 and JSON data can be read,
unless the nesting level is absurdly high.
