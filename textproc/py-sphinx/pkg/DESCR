Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents
consisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), by Georg Brandl.
It was originally created to translate the new Python documentation,
but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be useful to
many other projects.
