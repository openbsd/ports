Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation, grammar checking and
morphological analysis for Finnish language. Only spell checking is
supported for other languages through HFST backend.

Libvoikko aims to provide support for languages that are not well
served by Hunspell or other existing free linguistic tools. This can
be done because we do not care about compatibility with legacy
dictionary formats and we support only actively maintained languages.
Pushing new features to Hunspell where they would need to be
maintained essentially indefinitely should not be done until we have
gained enough experience to know which solutions work in the real
world.
