These are DSSSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD (they are also
completely compatible with the DocBook XML DTD).

DSSSL is a stylesheet language for both print and online rendering.
The acronym stands for Document Style Semantics and Specification
Language. It is defined by ISO/IEC 10179:1996. For more general
