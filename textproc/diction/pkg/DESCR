Diction and style are two old standard Unix commands. Diction identifies
wordy and commonly misused phrases. Style analyses surface
characteristics of a document, including sentence length and other
readability measures.

These programs cannot help you structure a document well, but they can
help to avoid poor wording and compare the readability (not the
understandability!) of your documents with others. Both commands support
English and German documents.
