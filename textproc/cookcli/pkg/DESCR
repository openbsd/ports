CookCLI provides a suite of commands to create shopping lists,
reports and maintain recipes. We've built it to be simple and useful
for automating your cooking and shopping routine with existing UNIX
command line and scripting tools. It can also function as a webserver
for your recipes, making them browsable on any device with a web
browser.
