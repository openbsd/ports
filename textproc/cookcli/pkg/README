| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides an rc script for the integrated "cook server" web
server, which serves content from a system-wide recipe directory located
at ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/cook.  Write permission can be granted by adding a user
to the _cook group.

Sample recipes and config files can be seeded using:

$ cd ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/cook && cook seed

Then, start the server:

# rcctl start cook_server

The web interface will be served on port 9080 to the local network.
