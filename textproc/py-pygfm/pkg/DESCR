This is an implementation of GitHub-Flavored Markdown written as an
extension to the Python Markdown library.

This library has well-known consistency issues with rendering and will
not receive bug fixes. Consider instead using pycmarkgfm, a lightweight
Python wrapper for GitHub's own implementation of GFM instead.
