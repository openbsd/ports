Boustrophedon is a reading-/writing-style that alternates direction
every line. It was originally created by the ancient Greeks. Once one
gets good at reading the 'backwards' text, reading (and writing) can
go much faster, as the eye (or hand) does not have to whip back to the
margin when the end of a line is reached. One simply goes down a line
and continues in the opposite direction.

In the case of a paragraph ending, the next paragraph should retain
the horizontal position, and (depending on which the text is closest
to: the center of the screen or the margin) continues in the same
direction, or continue in the opposite direction.

This program formats the text-files to be read in this manner.
