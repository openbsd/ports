NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit, is a suite of open source Python
modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and development in
Natural Language Processing.

A substantial amount of documentation about how to use NLTK, including a
textbook and API documention, is available from the NLTK website:
http://www.nltk.org/

By default not all the packages that can be used with NLTK have been
installed. It is recommended to manually install these. This can be
accomplished by issueing the following commands from the Python interpreter:

>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
