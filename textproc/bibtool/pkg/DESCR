BibTool allows the manipulation of BibTeX files which goes beyond
the possibilities -- and intentions -- of BibTeX.  The possibilities
of BibTool include

- Pretty-printing of BibTeX databases adjustable by lots of parameters.
- Syntactic checks with error recovery superior to BibTeX and helpful
  error messages.
- Semantic checks can be specified by the user.
- Sorting and merging of BibTeX databases according to a free definable
  sort key.
- Generation of uniform reference keys according to predefined rules or
  according to an own specification.
- Selecting references used in one publication which are found by
  analyzing an .aux file.
- Selecting references by a set of criteria (regular expressions).
- Controlled rewriting of fields utilizing regular expressions to
  specify the rewriting rules.
- Macro (String) expansion to eliminate the need of extra string
  definitions. Collecting statistics about one or more BibTeX databases.
