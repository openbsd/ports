This module parses a query string into a data structure to be handled 
by external search engines. For examples of such engines, see 
File::Tabular and Search::Indexer.

The query string can contain simple terms, "exact phrases", field 
names and comparison operators, '+/-' prefixes, parentheses, 
and boolean connectors.
