Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. You can compare two or three files
and edit them in place (diffs update dynamically). You can compare two
or three folders and launch file comparisons. You can browse and view a
working copy from popular version control systems such such as CVS,
Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial if the corresponding commands are
installed.
