wdiff is a front end to diff for comparing files on a word per word basis.
A word is anything between whitespace. This is useful for comparing two texts
in which a few words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been
refilled. It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line, and
then executes diff on these files. It collects the diff output and uses it
to produce a nicer display of word differences between the original files.
