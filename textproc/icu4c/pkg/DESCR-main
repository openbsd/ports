ICU (International Components for Unicode) is a set for C/C++ and Java
libraries providing Unicode and globalization support. icu4c is the
C/C++ version.

ICU services include code page conversion, collation (comparison using
locale-specific ordering), locale-wise formatting, Unicode regexp and

ICU is available under an open source non-copyleft licence.
