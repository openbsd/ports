The Ham m Radio Control Libraries, Hamlib for short, is a development
effort to provide a consistent interface for programmers wanting to
incorporate radio control in their programs. Hamlib is not a complete
user application, rather, it is a software layer intended to make
controlling various radios and other shack hardware much easier.
Hamlib will allow authors of such software as logging programs,
digital communications programs, or those wanting to develop the
ultimate radio control software to concentrate on the user interface
and the basic function of the program rather than radio control.
