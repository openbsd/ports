libmal is simply a convenience library of the object files contained in
Tom Whittaker's malsync distribution, along with a few wrapper
functions.
The malsync utility enables people who have Palm OS devices to sync to
Mobile Application Link (MAL) compliant servers.  AvantGo
(www.avantgo.com) and Puma Technologies (www.pumatech.com) are the first
two companies committing to producing servers which speak this protocol.
This utility will allow a user to sync with multiple servers,
simultaneously or separately.  The AvantGo.com service (www.avantgo.com)
is the first such server.
