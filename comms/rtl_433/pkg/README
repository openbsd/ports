Configuration examples
======================

Sample configurations and decoders for various RF devices are available in
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/rtl_433

Tuning and Performance
======================

The default sample rate used by rtl_433 may be too high for some hardware or
environments, potentially preventing capturing any packets.

Testing has shown that a sample rate of 1024k is generally stable and sufficient
for most supported devices. You can specify this rate using the -s flag:

# rtl_433 -s 1024k
