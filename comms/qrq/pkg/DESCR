qrq is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer which runs on several
operating systems (Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows), similar to the
classic DOS version of Rufz by DL4MM.

This tool is not intended for learning telegraphy (check out
https://lcwo.net for that!), but to improve the ability to copy
callsigns at high speeds, as needed for example for contesting or
for High-Speed Telegraphy (HST) competitions.

This port includes the Perl script qrqscore, that downloads and
uploads the global qrq toplist from the author's website.  qrqscore
requires p5-libwww, which is not included as an explicit dependency.
Use it at your own risk.
