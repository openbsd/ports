gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of making
it cross-platform and adding additional features. Our target audience are
professional developers and sysadmins (and especially teams of those) who are
well versed with a command line interface. One explicit goal for this project
is to make it more approachable to non-technical users. We go by the UNIX
philosophy and try to do one thing and do it well, providing a stellar user
experience and a sane, simple interface.
