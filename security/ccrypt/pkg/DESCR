ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It
was designed to replace the standard unix crypt utility, which is
notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on
the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate for
the Advanced Encryption Standard. This cipher is believed to provide
very strong security.
