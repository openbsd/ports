Hydra is a multi-protocol, parallelized authentication brute forcer.

By assigning many parallel tasks, remote login brute forcing can be
accelerated SIGNIFICANTLY, however it depends on the protocol.  The fastest is
generally POP3, then FTP, then Telnet, and the least IMAP.

Experiment with the task option (-t) to speed things up.  The higher, the
faster (but too high, and it disables the service).  To prevent disabling you
can now use the -g option for "slow-starts".

The following protocols are supported:

Cisco[-enable], FTP, HTTP[S], ICQ, IMAP, LDAP, NNTP, PCNFS, POP3, REXEC, SMB,
SOCKS5, TELNET, and VNC.
