librnp is a cross-platform C++ library providing an implementation of
OpenPGP (RFC4880). Unlike GPGME, it is standalone and doesn't call out
to the gnupg binary.
RNP is a set of tools built using this library providing key management
and the usual encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify functions - it can replace
gnupg for some uses.
