| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning with OpenBSD 7.8, you will not be able to use the "Yubico OTP
security key" MFA option with Bitwarden. You must add or use a different
authenticator which doesn't rely on OTP functionality prior to adding or
synchronizing an account.
