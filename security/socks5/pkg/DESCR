This is NWSL (previously CSTC) version 5.0 of SOCKS, a package that allows
Unix hosts behind a firewall to gain full access to the internet without
requiring direct IP reachability.  It does require a SOCKS server program
being run on a host that can communicate directly to hosts behind the
firewall as well as hosts on the Internet at large.  It is based on the
original SOCKS written by David Koblas <koblas@netcom.com> and the work of
the AFT working group of the IETF.
