OpenCDK (Open Crypto Development Kit) provides basic parts of the
OpenPGP message format. The aim of the library is *not* to replace any
available OpenPGP version. There will be no real support for key
management (sign, revoke, alter preferences, etc) and some other parts
are only rudimentary available. The main purpose is to handle and
understand OpenPGP packets and to use basic operations.
