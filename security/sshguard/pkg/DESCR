sshguard protects hosts from brute force attacks. It supports IPv6,
whitelists and log authentication, interfaces with all the major
firewalling systems, has a remarkably clever log analyzer, and is
independent, fast and lightweight as it's written in C.

Parsers cover OpenSSH, several MTAs, IMAP/POP3 and ftp daemons.
