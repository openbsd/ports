HKDF - HMAC Key Derivation Function

This module implements the HMAC Key Derivation function, defined at
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-krawczyk-hkdf-01

There are two interfaces: a functional interface, with separate extract and
expand functions as defined in the draft RFC, and a wrapper class for these
functions.
