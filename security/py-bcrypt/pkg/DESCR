py-bcrypt is a Python wrapper of OpenBSD's Blowfish password hashing code,
as described in "A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme" by Niels Provos and
David Mazières.

This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's
Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost of
off-line password cracking and frustrate fast hardware implementation.
The computation cost of the algorithm is parametised, so it can be
increased as computers get faster. The intent is to make a compromise
of a password database less likely to result in an attacker gaining
knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using John the Ripper).
