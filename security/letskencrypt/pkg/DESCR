letskencrypt is yet another Let's Encrypt client, but one with a
strong focus on security. It is still under development.

It supports the following operations:

* Account registration (see the -n flag).
* Domain certificate signing.
* Domain certificate revocation (see the -r flag).

Many parts of the process are run as jailed unprivileged processes.
