The hackage security library provides both server and client utilities
for securing the Hackage package server (http://hackage.haskell.org/).
It is based on The Update Framework (http://theupdateframework.com/),
a set of recommendations developed by security researchers at various
universities in the US as well as developers on the Tor project
(https://www.torproject.org/).

The current implementation supports only index signing, thereby
enabling untrusted mirrors. It does not yet provide facilities for
author package signing.
