ClusterSSH opens terminal windows with connections to specified hosts
and an administration console. Any text typed into the administration
console is replicated to all other connected and active windows.
This tool is intended for, but not limited to, cluster administration
where the same configuration or commands must be run on each node within
the cluster. Performing these commands all at once via this tool ensures
all nodes are kept in sync.
