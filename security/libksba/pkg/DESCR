Libksba is a library to make the tasks of working with X.509
certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It provides a
highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents the data
in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry about all the nasty
details of the protocols. The API gives the C programmer an easy way of
interacting with the data. It copes with the version details X.509
protocols tend to have as well as with the many different versions and
dialects. Applications must usually cope with all of this and it has to
be coded over and over again. Libksba hides this by providing just one
API which does the Right Thing. Support for new features will be added
as needed.
