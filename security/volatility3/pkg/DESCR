Volatility is the world's most widely used framework for extracting
digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction
techniques are performed completely independent of the system being
investigated but offer visibility into the runtime state of the system.
The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and
complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile
memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this
exciting area of research.

In 2019, the Volatility Foundation released a complete rewrite of the
framework, Volatility 3. The project was intended to address many of the
technical and performance challenges associated with the original code
base that became apparent over the previous 10 years. Another benefit of
the rewrite is that Volatility 3 could be released under a custom
license that was more aligned with the goals of the Volatility
community, the Volatility Software License (VSL).
