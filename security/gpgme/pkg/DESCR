GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to
GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a high-level crypto API
for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.

Currently it uses GnuPG's OpenPGP backend as its default but the
API isn't restricted to this engine.
