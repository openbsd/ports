service_identity aspires to give you all the tools you need for
verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.

In the simplest case, this means host name verification.  However,
service_identity implements RFC 6125 fully and plans to add other
relevant RFCs too.

Use this package if:

- you use pyOpenSSL and don't want to be MITMed

- you want to verify that a PyCA cryptography certificate is valid
for a certain hostname or IP address
