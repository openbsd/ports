| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Configuration
=====================

The user running cvechecker(1) must be part of the _cvechecker group:
    # usermod -G _cvechecker <username>

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/cvechecker.conf to your particular setup, this is
especially important when using MariaDB as a backend.

Database initialization
-----------------------
When using MariaDB (cvechecker-3.2-mysql), a database and user must be
setup. This step is not needed when using SQLite.
    $ mysql -uroot -p<password>
    MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE cvechecker;
    MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `cvechecker` . *
                    -> TO 'cvechecker_rw'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password4cvechecker_rw';
    MariaDB [(none)]> QUIT

Then the database initialization is done by running:
    $ cvechecker -i
(this step is required for both MariaDB and SQLite).

At last, the CVE data needs to be put into the database:
    $ pullcves pull
Note that the first time this command is run, it will take a long time.
Subsequent calls to pullcves(1) will only update the current year and
will be must faster. It is advised to run this command regularly to make
sure the local CVE database is up to date with upstream.

Getting started with cvechecker
===============================

cvechecker(1) will scan a list of files and check whether there is a
corresponding CVE according to its version. For example, to check
binaries from installed packages(7):
    $ find ${LOCALBASE}/{bin,libexec,sbin} -type f -perm -o+x > scanlist.txt
    $ cvechecker -b scanlist.txt
    $ cvechecker -r
