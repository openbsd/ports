		      [ ADMfzap 0.1 by plaguez ]

	  a libdl-based connect() and bind() wrapper that
	  helps bypassing poorly configured packet filters.


ADMfzap makes all (or most of) your connect() and bind()
calls originating from port 20 (tcp, ftp-data) or 53 (udp,
dns). Alternatly, the source port can also be configured
via the environment variable $LOPORT.
