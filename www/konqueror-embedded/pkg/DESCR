Stand-alone konqueror web-browser. Based on kde 2.2 source code.
Does not require kde2, only qt2.

- good javascript support, 
- https support, but does not show certificates,
- ftp support.

Still somewhat experimental, crashes.

See ${PREFIX}/bin/konq-e for cache/proxy support.

Flavors:
	kiosk - Build with the "Kiosk" GUI
	debug - Build with options suitable for debugging
