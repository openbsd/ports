WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation
toolkit. It consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends
in a sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme.  Each backend provides
one particular core language.  For maximum power WML additionally ships
with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
features built on top of the backend core languages.  While not trivial
and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real hackers
always wanted for HTML generation.
