JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter
offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter
Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich
outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface.

JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.
