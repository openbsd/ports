mod_random provides three services.  The first service is as a
redirector.  You feed it URLs and it will redirect to random URLs that
you have loaded.  The second is that it provides environmental variables
that can be used for doing ad banner systems.  The third is that it can
be used to display entire pages of random html.  It uses its own custom
handlers in combination with random ads and quotes that you feed into
the system.
