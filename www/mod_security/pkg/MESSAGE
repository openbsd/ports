To finish the install of ${PKGNAME}, you need
to enable the module using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_security-enable

The manual is found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_security.

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then start the server.
