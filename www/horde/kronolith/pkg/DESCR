Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable and
featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, with integrated
collaboration/scheduling features. It makes extensive use of the Horde
Framework to provide integration with other applications.

Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system,
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, shared
calendars, iCalendar support, generation of free/busy information, and
managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The calendar API that
Kronolith uses is abstracted; available backends include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, MSSQL, MCAL and Kolab.

To complete the installation, be sure that Horde is configured and
working, then see ${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL
