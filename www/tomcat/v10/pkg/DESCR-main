Tomcat 10 is a Servlet/JSP container that implements the Servlet 5.0
and JavaServer Pages 3.0 specifications from the Java Community
Process. Tomcat includes many additional features that make it a
useful platform for developing and deploying web applications and
web services.  Tomcat can be run as a standalone web server with
Servlet and JSP support, or using Apache HTTP Server as its web
server via the mod_jk Apache module (the www/mod_jk package).
