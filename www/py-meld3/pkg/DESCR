meld3 is an HTML/XML templating system for Python which keeps template markup
and dynamic rendering logic separate from one another.

*** WARNING ***
No further development of the meld3 package is planned.  The meld3 package
should be considered unmaintained as of April 2020.  Since 2007, meld3
received only minimal updates to keep compatible with newer Python versions.
It was only maintained because it was a dependency of the Supervisor package.
Since Supervisor 4.1.0 (released in October 2019), the meld3 package is
no longer a dependency of Supervisor.
