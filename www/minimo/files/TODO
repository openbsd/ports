- keep it from crashing...
- zaurus/arm support (need proper xptc asm stubs for arm)
- some patches from mozilla don't apply anymore, need to doublecheck them:
	patch-gfx_src_gtk_nsDeviceContextSpecG_cpp 
	patch-nsprpub_pr_src_io_prprf_c
- configure looks for libgnomeui
- make sure gnomevfs isn't needed
- don't hardcode /usr/local in ${FILESDIR}/minimo
- ~/.Minimo -> ~/.minimo maybe
- install method could use some tweaks
