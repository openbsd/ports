A Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making
cross-origin AJAX possible.

This package has a simple philosophy, when you want to enable CORS, you wish to
enable it for all use cases on a domain. This means no mucking around with
different allowed headers, methods, etc. By default, submission of cookies
across domains is disabled due to the security implications, please see the
documentation for how to enable credential'ed requests, and please make sure
you add some sort of CSRF protection before doing so!
