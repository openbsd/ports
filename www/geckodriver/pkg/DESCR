Proxy for using W3C WebDriver compatible clients to interact with Gecko-based
browsers.

This program provides the HTTP API described by the WebDriver protocol to
communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox. It translates calls into the
Firefox remote protocol by acting as a proxy between the local- and remote
ends.
