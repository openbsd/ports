The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of common techniques for
minimizing the size of HTML files. You can typically save between 10%
and 50% of the size of a HTML file using these methods. It provides the
following features:

- Remove unneeded whitespace (begining of line, etc)
- Remove unneeded META elements.
- Remove HTML comments (except for styles, javascript and SSI)
- Replace tags with equivilant shorter tags (<strong> --> <b>)
- etc.

The entire proces is configurable, so you can pick and choose what you want
to clean.
