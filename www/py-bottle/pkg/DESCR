Bottle is a fast and simple micro-framework for small web applications. It
offers request dispatching (URL routing) with URL parameter support, templates,
a built-in HTTP Server and adapters for many third party WSGI/HTTP-server and
template engines - all in a single file and with no dependencies other than the
Python Standard Library.
