w3m is a pager/text-based WWW browser.  It is similar to Lynx, but
it has several features Lynx doesn't have:

* w3m can render tables
* w3m can render frames (by converting frames into tables)
* w3m can display documents from standard input
* w3m is small

The multilingualization (m17n) extension allows to display pages
in all kinds of scripts and encodings in a UTF-8 xterm.

Available flavors:
  image         - Supports displaying inline images when run from an X11
                  terminal emulator.
  japanese      - Provide Japanese menus and documentation.
