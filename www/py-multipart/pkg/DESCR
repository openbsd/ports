"multipart" is a fast incremental non-blocking parser for multipart/form-data,
as well as blocking alternatives for easier use in WSGI or CGI applications.

- 100% test coverage with test data from actual browsers and HTTP clients.
- High throughput and low latency.
- Predictable memory and disk resource consumption via fine grained limits.
- Strict mode: Spent less time parsing malicious or broken inputs.

All parsers in this module implement multipart/form-data as defined by
HTML5 and RFC7578, supporting all modern browsers or HTTP clients in use
today. Legacy browsers (e.g. IE6) are supported to some degree, but only
if the required workarounds do not impact performance or security. In
detail this means:

Just multipart/form-data, not suitable for email parsing.
No multipart/mixed support (deprecated in RFC7578).
No base64 or quoted-printable transfer encoding (deprecated in RFC7578).
No encoded-word or name=_charset_ encoding markers (deprecated in HTML5).
No support for clearly broken clients (e.g. invalid line breaks or headers).
