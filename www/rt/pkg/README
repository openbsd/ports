| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to complete your rt installations you will first need to
initialize the database by following these steps.

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/rt/RT_SiteConfig.pm and make the appropriate
adjustments for your database environment and then run

# rt-setup-database --dba <yourdbauser> --action init \
	--prompt-for-dba-password

Once the database has been initialized you will need to configure
httpd. Instructions for configuring httpd can be found in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/rt/README

If you are upgrading your installation, don't forget to run:
# rt-setup-database --dba <yourdbauser> --prompt-for-dba-password \
	--action upgrade

It is also recommended to clear the mason cache on every package update
by simply removing the whole cache directory:
# rm -rf /var/www/rt/mason_data/obj/*
