For YouTube support, one of the following JS runtimes is required to be
installed:
* deno
* quickjs
* node

deno is used by default on amd64/aarch64 as it is the default upstream option.
An alternative can be selected by passing the --js-runtimes <runtime> flag.
This will also be required on other architectures.
