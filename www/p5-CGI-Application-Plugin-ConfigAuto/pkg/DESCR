CGI::Application::Plugin::ConfigAuto adds easy access to config file
variables to your CGI::Application modules.  Lazy loading is used to
prevent the config file from being parsed if no configuration variables
are accessed during the request.  In other words, the config file is not
parsed until it is actually needed.  The Config::Auto package provides
the framework for this plugin.
