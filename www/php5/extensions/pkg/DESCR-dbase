These functions allow you to access records stored in dBase-format
(dbf) databases.

There is no support for indexes or memo fields. There is no support
for locking, too. Two concurrent webserver processes modifying the
same dBase file will very likely ruin your database.

dBase files are simple sequential files of fixed length records.
Records are appended to the end of the file and delete records are
kept until you call dbase_pack().

We recommend that you do not use dBase files as your production
database. Choose any real SQL server instead; MySQL or Postgres are
common choices with PHP. dBase support is here to allow you to
import and export data to and from your web database, because the
file format is commonly understood by Windows spreadsheets and
organizers.
