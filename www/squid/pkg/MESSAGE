NOTES ON OpenBSD POST-INSTALLATION OF SQUID 2.2.RELEASE
-------------------------------------------------------

 ** An old squid.conf will not work with squid 2.2! **

Documentation on Squid is available at http://squid.nlanr.net/
The local (OpenBSD) differences are:
- configuration files are in		/etc/squid
- sample configuration files are in	/usr/local/lib/squid/conf
- error message files are in		/usr/local/share/squid/errors
- sample error message files are in	/usr/local/lib/squid/errors
- icons are in 				/usr/local/share/squid/icons
- sample icons are in			/usr/local/lib/squid/icons
- the cache is in 			/var/squid/cache
- logs are stored in 			/var/squid/logs
- the ugid squid runs as is		www:www

You can also edit /etc/rc.local so that Squid is started automatically:
    if [ -x /usr/local/bin/squid ]; then
	echo -n ' squid';	/usr/local/bin/squid &
    fi

Happy caching!
