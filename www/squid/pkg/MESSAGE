NOTES ON OpenBSD POST-INSTALLATION OF SQUID 2.5
-----------------------------------------------

 ** An old squid.conf will not work with Squid 2.5! **

The local (OpenBSD) differences are:
- configuration files are in		${SYSCONFDIR}
- sample configuration files are in	${PREFIX}/share/examples/squid
- error message files are in		${PREFIX}/share/squid/errors
- sample error message files are in	${PREFIX}/share/examples/squid/errors
- icons are in 				${PREFIX}/share/squid/icons
- sample icons are in			${PREFIX}/share/examples/squid/icons
- the cache is in 			${SQUIDDIR}/cache
- logs are stored in 			${SQUIDDIR}/logs
- the ugid squid runs as is		squid:squid

Please remember to initialize the cache by running "squid -z" before
trying to run Squid for the first time.

You can also edit /etc/rc.local so that Squid is started automatically:
    if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/squid ]; then
	echo -n ' squid';	${PREFIX}/bin/squid
    fi
