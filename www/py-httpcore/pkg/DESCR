The HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client,
which does one thing only. Sending HTTP requests.

It does not provide any high level model abstractions over the API,
does not handle redirects, multipart uploads, building authentication
headers, transparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, session cookie
handling, content or charset decoding, handling JSON, environment
based configuration defaults, or any of that Jazz.
