The Zope Content Management Framework provides a set of services
and content objects useful for building highly dynamic, content-oriented
portal sites.  As packaged, the CMF generates a site much like the
Zope.org site.  The CMF is intended to be easily customizable, in
terms of both the types of content used and the policies and services
it provides.
