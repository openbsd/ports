The Webalizer is a web server log file analysis program which produces
usage statistics in HTML format for viewing with a browser.  The results
are presented in both columnar and graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation.  Yearly, monthly, daily and hourly usage statistics are
presented, along with the ability to display usage by site, URL, referrer,
user agent (browser), search string, entry/exit page, username and country
(some information is only available if supported and present in the log
files being processed).  Processed data may also be exported into most
database and spreadsheet programs that support tab delimited data formats.

The Webalizer supports CLF (common log format) log files, as well as
Combined log formats as defined by NCSA and others, and variations
of these which it attempts to handle intelligently.  In addition, wu-ftpd
xferlog formatted logs and squid proxy logs are supported.

Gzip compressed logs may now be used as input directly.  Any log filename
that ends with a '.gz'xtension will be assumed to be in gzip format and
uncompressed on the fly as it is being read.  In addition, the Webalizer
also supports DNS lookup capabilities if enabled at compile time.

The OpenBSD port enables Reverse-DNS lookup by default.
