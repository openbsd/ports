HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation
for perl.  It is not intended as a replacement for the
fully-featured LWP module.  Instead, it is intended for use in
situations where it is desirable to install the minimal number of
modules to achieve HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good
candidate due to CPU overhead, such as slower processors.
HTTP::Lite is also significantly faster than LWP.
