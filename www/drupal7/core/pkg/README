To enable a decent configuration of drupal, please create a symbolic
link:

ln -sf ../modules.sample/${DRUPAL}.conf \
	${TRUEPREFIX}/conf/modules

If you just want to try out drupal, you don't need any database server,
an sqlite file will do just fine.

In order to run with standard OpenBSD chroot'ed httpd:

- make sure you can connect to your database.

Create a directory for the mysql socket and adjust permissions:

	install -d -g _mysql -o _mysql /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot.

	[client]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

	[mysqld]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

create user drupal@localhost identified by 'password';
create database drupal character set utf8;
grant all on drupal.* to drupal@localhost;

In postgresql, assuming an `admin' account has all rights:

createuser -U admin --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole drupal
createdb -U drupal -E UTF8 drupal

Updating from a drupal6 installation:
- to do
