You may need to crank shared memory limits for chromium to work
properly under load:

# sysctl kern.shminfo.shmall=32768

And opening lots of tabs may necessitate higher fd limits,
crank that via ulimit/limits.

This package currently requires a CPU supporting SSE2.
You can check this with: dmesg | grep 'cpu.*SSE2'
