If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Using mailto: links

To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Enabling ECC cipher suites

Open the URL about:config and type security.ssl3 in the search
filter. This will bring up a list of all available cipher suites.
Double-click on any cipher to toggle its state. For example, to
enable TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, double-click on
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_aes128_sha until its boolean entry in the
Value column changes to true.

Debugging

If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run 'firefox -g' to run firefox inside gdb, so
that you can gather debugging logs and traces.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

H.264 support

Due to licensing reasons, you have to manually install the
gstreamer-ffmpeg package to play H.264 videos.
