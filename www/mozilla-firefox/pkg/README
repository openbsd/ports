If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Using mailto: links

To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Enabling ECC cipher suites

Open the URL about:config and type security.ssl3 in the search
filter. This will bring up a list of all available cipher suites.
Double-click on any cipher to toggle its state. For example, to
enable TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, double-click on
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_aes128_sha until its boolean entry in the
Value column changes to true.

Using CUPS and LPR for printing

Since version 3, Firefox uses the standard printing dialog from gtk+2.
In order to use CUPS for printing, you will need to install the cups
subpackage of gtk+2, i.e.:

# pkg_add gtk+2-cups

Debugging

If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run 'firefox -g' to run firefox inside gdb, so
that you can gather debugging logs and traces.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.
