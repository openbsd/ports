Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects
like screen-scraping from web pages. Three features make it powerful:

Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for
navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for
dissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take much
code to write an application.

Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and
outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings,
unless the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't
detect one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding.

Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and
html5lib, allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade
speed for flexibility.

Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree traversal
stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links", or "Find all the
links of class externalLink", or "Find all the links whose urls match
"foo.com", or "Find the table heading that's got bold text, then give me
that text."

Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites is
now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take only
minutes with Beautiful Soup.
