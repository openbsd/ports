| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The GitList repository viewer has been installed into
${INSTDIR}

PHP settings
============
Some specific PHP settings are required for GitList. With Apache, you can
automatically configure them as follows. As root:
    ln -s ../modules.sample/gitlist.conf /var/www/conf/modules
    /etc/rc.d/httpd restart

With other web servers, review
    ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/zurmo.conf
to use them as a a template to adjust various PHP settings in
${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.ini.

Webserver settings
==================
You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../gitlist /var/www/htdocs/gitlist
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading:
https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist/blob/master/INSTALL.md

You can ensure you have a working installation by accessing:
http://<localhost>/gitlist/
