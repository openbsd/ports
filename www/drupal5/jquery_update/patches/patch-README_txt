-This module facilitates the upgrade of jQuery in Drupal 5.  jQuery 1.0.1 is
-included with Drupal 5, however it is not very well supported in the jQuery
-community. In order to use most current and advanced jQuery functionality
-you will want to build off a newer version of jQuery. This module includes
-John Resig's compat-1.0.js and compat-1.1js plugins compiled into a compat.js
-file that provides backwards compatiblity for newer versions of jQuery to work
-with JavaScript code in Drupal 5.
-
-The main issue with this module is that you will need to *copy* all *.js files
-from the jquery_update/misc folder and place them in Drupal core's misc/ folder,
-replacing each file with these updated JavaScript files.
-
-If you fail to do this, the jQuery Update module will warn you about this
-problem.
-
-INSTALLATION:
-
-1) Place this module directory in your modules folder (this will usually be
-   "sites/all/modules/").
-
-2) Enable the module.
-
-3) Copy all *.js files from the jquery_update/misc folder and place them in
-   Drupal core's misc/ folder, replacing the files that already exist.
-
-   Note: You will receive a warning message in Drupal's administration area if
-   you do not perform this step correctly.
-
-You will need to repeat step #3 whenever you update your Drupal installation.
-
+OpenBSD already patched drupal for  jquery_update to work as-is.
