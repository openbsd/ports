To enable a decent configuration of drupal, please create a symbolic
link from ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal.conf
to ${PREFIX}/conf/modules/drupal.conf

ln -s ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal.conf \
	${PREFIX}/conf/modules

It is highly recommended to setup https (see SSL(8)) and to
enable securelogin.

In order to run with standard OpenBSD chroot'ed httpd:

- make sure you can connect to your database.

Create a directory for the mysql socket.

	mkdir -p /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot.

	[client]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

	[mysqld]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

create user drupal@localhost identified by 'password';
create database drupal character set utf8;
grant all on drupal.* to drupal@localhost;

In postgresql, assuming an `admin' account has all rights:

createuser -U admin --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole drupal
createdb -U drupal -E UTF8 drupal
