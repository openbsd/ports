Autobahn|Python is a subproject of Autobahn and provides open-source
implementations of the WebSocket Protocol and the Web Application
Messaging Protocol (WAMP) for Python 2 and 3, and running on Twisted
and asyncio.

You can use Autobahn|Python to create clients and servers in Python
speaking just plain WebSocket or WAMP.

WebSocket allows bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web and
beyond, while WAMP adds real-time application communication on top of
WebSocket.

WAMP provides asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls and Publish &
Subscribe for applications in one protocol running over WebSocket.
WAMP is a routed protocol, so you need a WAMP Router to connect your
Autobahn|Python based clients. We provide Crossbar.io, but there are
other options as well.
