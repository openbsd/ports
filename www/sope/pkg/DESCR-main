The SOPE package is an extensive set of frameworks (16 frameworks, ~1500
classes) which form a complete Web application server environment.
Besides the Apple WebObjects compatible appserver extended with Zope
concepts, it contains a large set of reusable classes: XML processing
(SAX2, DOM, XML-RPC), MIME/IMAP4 processing, LDAP connectivity, RDBMS
connectivity, and iCalendar parsing.
