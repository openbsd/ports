Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited
for dynamic-content web applications. Two separate modes of operations
are supported:

    * Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular webserver daemon.
      This is the default mode.
    * Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded webserver in another
      Erlang application.

Yaws is entirely written in Erlang, and furthermore it is a
multithreaded webserver where one Erlang lightweight process is used to
handle each client.
