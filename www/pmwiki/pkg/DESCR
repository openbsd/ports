PmWiki is a wiki-based system for collaborative creation and maintenance
of websites.  PmWiki pages look and act like normal web pages, except
they have an "Edit" link that makes it easy to modify existing pages and
add new pages into the website, using basic editing rules. You do not
need to know or use any HTML or CSS.  Page editing can be left open to
the public or restricted to small groups of authors.
