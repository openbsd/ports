Active Resource (ARes) connects business objects and Representational State
Transfer (REST) web services. It implements object-relational mapping for
REST webservices to provide transparent proxying capabilities between a
client (ActiveResource) and a RESTful service (which is provided by Simply
RESTful routing in ActionController::Resources).
