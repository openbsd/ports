This package is a simple wrapper around pyrate-limiter v2 that adds
convenient integration with the requests library.

Features
 - pyrate-limiter is a general-purpose rate-limiting library that
   implements the leaky bucket algorithm, supports multiple rate limits,
   and has optional persistence with SQLite and Redis backends
 - requests-ratelimiter adds some conveniences for sending rate-limited
   HTTP requests with the requests library
 - It can be used as either a session or a transport adapter
 - It can also be used as a mixin, for compatibility with other
   requests-based libraries
 - Rate limits are tracked separately per host
 - Different rate limits can optionally be applied to different hosts
