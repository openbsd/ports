To finish the install of mod_mp3, you need
to enable the module by using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/${MODAPACHE_ENABLE}

Also, copy the following file into your Apache config
directory:

  ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mod_mp3/mp3.conf

Add the following line to your httpd.conf:

  include conf/mp3.conf

Edit mp3.conf to suit your needs. 

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
