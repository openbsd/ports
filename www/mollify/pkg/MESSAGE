Proceed to configure the software by opening the web-based installer
at http://yourhost/mollify/backend/install/ and following the directions
to modify ${INSTDIR}/backend/configuration.php

Mollify optionally supports MySQL configuration storage; the installer
can create the tables for you if you install the php5-mysqli package.
