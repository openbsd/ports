NScache is simple program for viewing and managing the contents of Netscape(tm)
browser(s) cache directory.

It has a very easy user interface written by using the GTK+ widget libraries.
It shows 3 tree levels of cache contents. At the first level are protocols, at 
the second level are servers and at the third level are regular documents.

For each document the URL is shown, name of cache file, its size, MIME type,
encoding type, character set for HTML documents, modification time, access
time and time when the document expires.

When you press right mouse button inside the tree list, you can make any 
action on selected item(s). You can save files from the cache to other 
locations, you can remove files and entries from the chache (one or all 
entries for server), or you can compute numbers of documents in sub-trees 
and size of all documents in the sub-tree. You can launch any viewer 
command on cache file or on source URL. The viewers you can assign to any 
MIME type. You can also copy selected URL to clipboard.
