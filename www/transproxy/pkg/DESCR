transproxy - transparently proxy HTTP and other requests.

This program is used with pf(4) to intercept things like http requests and
divert them to a www proxy server (eg: squid), without requiring user
intervention or configuration.

It accepts connections on the redirected port, connects to the real proxy
server and transports data between the two sockets.

Unlike some other transparent proxy solutions, this does not require the
proxy to run on the machine itself.
