w3m is a pager/text-based WWW browser.  It is similar to Lynx, but
it has several features Lynx doesn't have:

* w3m can render tables
* w3m can render frames (by converting frames into tables)
* w3m can display documents from standard input
* w3m is small

The kanji flavor provides Japanese menus and documentation, and
properly displays Japanese characters in kterm.

The multilingualization (m17n) flavor allows to display pages in
all kinds of scripts and encodings in a UTF-8 xterm.
