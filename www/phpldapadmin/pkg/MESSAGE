phpLDAPAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Edit ${INSTDIR}/config/config.php to configure phpLDAPAdmin

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../phpldapadmin /var/www/htdocs/phpldapadmin
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

For jpeg photos to work properly, you must do this:       
	# mkdir /var/www/tmp                 
	# chown www:daemon /var/www/tmp       
	# chmod 1755 /var/www/tmp       
Where tmp is the $jpeg_temp_dir configured in config.php       

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/phpldapadmin/index.php
