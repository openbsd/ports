| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The phpPgAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../phpPgAdmin /var/www/htdocs/phpPgAdmin
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/phpPgAdmin/index.php

You need to modify ${INSTDIR}/conf/config.inc.php according
to your database(s) settings
