bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP version 1.1 server.  Its main
feature is the lack of features, reducing the code size and improving
verifiability.  It supports CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user
translations, virtual hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based
servers on a single machine, over IPv4 and v6.  It has SSL support.  It
has no configuration file by design.
