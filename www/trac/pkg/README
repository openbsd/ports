Initial setup
=============

To configure a Trac environment, you must run the following command
and follow the prompts:
    sudo -u _trac trac-admin </path/to/projectenv> initenv

Here, "</path/to/projectenv>" is the location on your disk where you
want to place the project environment. The _trac user will need the
appropriate permissions.

"</path/to/projectenv/conf/trac.ini>" is the configuration file of your
project environment which allows to setup the name of the project, etc.

To get started with Trac, you can use the built-in webserver.
Configure the daemon flags in /etc/rc.conf.local with a suitable port
and path if the defaults (/var/www/trac and port 8085) are not suitable:

tracd_flags=-p 8085 </path/to/projectenv>

And start the daemon:

# ${RCDIR}/tracd start

Now you can open up a web brower and go to http://localhost:8085/. You
should see a single link for the project you just created. If you follow
the link, you should see trac in action.

Further information
