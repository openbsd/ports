This subclass of Rose::HTML::Form::Field::Text is intended to make it easier
to integrate Ajax autocompletion into your web applications. You define
a URL where your web application can find suggested values for the field,
and optionally, a limit on the number of suggestions returned by the server.

This subclass is expected to be used with 
Catalyst::Controller::Rose::Autocomplete but that is not required.
