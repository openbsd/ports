Flask-Limiter adds rate limiting to Flask applications.

By adding the extension to your flask application, you can configure
various rate limits at different levels (e.g. application wide, per
Blueprint, routes, resource etc).

Flask-Limiter can be configured to persist the rate limit state to
many commonly used storage backends via the limits library.
