This module strips scripting constructs out of HTML, leaving as much
non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows web applications
to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without
introducing XSS (cross site scripting) vulnerabilities.
You will probably use HTML::StripScripts::Parser rather than using this
module directly.
