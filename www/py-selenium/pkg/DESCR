Selenium automates browsers.  Primarily it is for automating web
applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to
just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!)
also be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors
who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native
part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless
other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.'
