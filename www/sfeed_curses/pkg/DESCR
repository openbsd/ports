sfeed_curses is a curses UI front-end for sfeed.

It shows the TAB-separated feed items in a graphical command-line UI. The
interface has a look inspired by the mutt mail client. It has a sidebar panel
for the feeds, a panel with a listing of the items and a small statusbar for
the selected item/url. Some functions like searching and scrolling are
integrated in the interface itself.
