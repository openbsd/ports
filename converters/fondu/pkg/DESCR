A set of programs to interconvert between mac font formats and pfb,
ttf, otf and bdf files on unix.

Dealing with mac fonts is hard on other operating systems because mac
fonts are stored in the resource fork, and other operating systems do
not support this concept. Fondu will extract the resource fork from
either a macbinary file or a binhex file. Ufond will create a resource
fork inside a macbinary file.
