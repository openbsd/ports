This library implements a deserializer for an efficient, compact-output,
and feature-rich binary protocol called Sereal.

Its sister module p5-Sereal-Encoder implements an encoder for this format.

Always upgrade the Decoder before the Encoder. The latest version of
the decoder (this package) should be able to handle the output from
any earlier or equivalent version of the encoder. Ignoring this advice
may result in data loss in an environment where you cannot upgrade the
encoder simultaneously on all machines using the package.
