This is an object-oriented module to convert dates into the Shire Calendar as
presented in the Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. It includes converting
epoch time to the Shire Calendar (you can also get epoch time back), comparison
operators, and a method to print a formatted string containing that does
something to the effect of on this date in history -- pulling events from the
Lord of the Rings.
