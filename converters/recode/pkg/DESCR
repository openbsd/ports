The Recode library converts files between character sets and usages.
It recognises or produces over 200 different character sets (or about
300 if combined with an iconv library) and transliterates files between
almost any pair. When exact transliterations are not possible, it gets
rid of offending characters or falls back on approximations.

The recode(1) program is a handy front-end to the library.
