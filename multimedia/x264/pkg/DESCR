x264 is a free library for encoding H264/AVC video streams.

This program requires a processor with recent instructions (MMX/SSE for
i386, AltiVec for powerpc).

Encoder features:
 * CAVLC/CABAC
 * Multi-references
 * Intra: all macroblock types (16x16, 8x8, and 4x4 with all predictions)
 * Inter P: all partitions (from 16x16 down to 4x4)
 * Inter B: partitions from 16x16 down to 8x8 (including skip/direct)
 * Ratecontrol: constant quantizer, single or multipass ABR, optional VBV
 * Scene cut detection
 * Adaptive B-frame placement
 * B-frames as references / arbitrary frame order
 * 8x8 and 4x4 adaptive spatial transform
 * Lossless mode
 * Custom quantization matrices
 * Parallel encoding of multiple slices
 * Interlacing
