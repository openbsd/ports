Use a libtool-wrapper script for NASM.

Libtool thinks NASM acts just like the C-compiler, which isn't true
for e.g. -f options. Previously we used -prefer-non-pic to avoid libtool
passing any additional flags, which worked well on all tested platforms
but as it turns out at least on OpenBSD this does not work.
This now also means we'll automatically get the -DPIC flag as needed,
which might perhaps also help some platforms we didn't test yet; before
we fully relied on x86inc's automatic setting for PIC in assembly.
