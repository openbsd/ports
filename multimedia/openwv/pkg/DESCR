OpenWV is a free and open-source reimplementation of Google's Widevine Content 
Decryption Module (CDM), the portion of the Widevine DRM system that runs in 
your browser, obtains content keys for protected media, and decrypts the media 
using those keys. OpenWV is a drop-in replacement for Google's official, 
proprietary CDM and implements the same shared library API.
