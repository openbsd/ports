OpenWV does _not_ come with a device identity and will not work without one.
A device identity, typically stored as a [.wvd] file, contains metadata about
a Widevine client as well as a private key that authenticates that client to
Widevine license servers.
If you want to use OpenWV, you must obtain an appropriate wvd file yourself,
and copy it to /etc/openwv/widevine_device.wvd

Please refer to the project's homepage for more information.
