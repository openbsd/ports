xnec2c is a high-performance multi-threaded electromagnetic simulation
package to model antenna near- and far-field radiation patterns for
Linux and UNIX operating systems. The original FORTRAN version of NEC2
was ported to C by Neoklis Kyriazis, 5B4AZ and released as nec2c. The
same author wrote xnec2c, a graphical interface for ease of use with
many more features.

xnec2c has a built-in editor for NEC2 input files which can be used to
edit geometry or command "card" data, as well as a set of visual pop-up
editor windows that open when appropriate buttons are clicked or when a
selected row is right-clicked with the mouse. These editors allow
easier, more convenient entry and editing of individual rows, with no
need for detailed knowledge of NEC2 "card" formats.

xnec2c can simulate and visualise 3D radiation plots, near-field plots,
and frequency data plots. It comes with an extensive set of example
files, containing NEC2 models for a variety of antennas.
