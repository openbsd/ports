OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free
software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike
most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does
not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on
the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking
for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but
pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more
interested in creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something
like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the
object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives
you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and
enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or
make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.

OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is
constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion
of 2D outlines. Autocad DXF files can be used as the data exchange
format for such 2D outlines. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion
it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides
DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF
file formats.
