The Samba suite is a set of programs that implement a server for the
Windows file- and printer-sharing protocols (SMB/CIFS).

Samba allows Windows clients to use filesystem space and printers of
your OpenBSD system as if they were local drives or printers.

While configuration for larger sites can be quite complex, the default
installation of this package allows for immediate use of your OpenBSD
machine as a server for Windows clients.
