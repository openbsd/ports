Configuration
=============
The configuration file, found at ${SYSCONFDIR}/samba/smb.conf can be used right
away for simple configurations.  Local users should be added to the
Samba user database using the pdbedit(1) utility in order to use the
Samba server.

# pdbedit -a -u <username>

Install the samba-docs package and see documentation files in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/samba and example config files in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/samba for more information.

Useful documentation is also available from the Samba wiki at

  https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page

Winbind
=======
Winbind on OpenBSD does not support local user logins as there
is no nsswitch support.  Winbind support is included for external
systems like Dovecot or Squid that are able to use it to authenticate
users.

Nmbd and AD DC mode
===================
Note that nmbd(8) daemon currently doesn't work properly when samba is
set up as an AD DC controller.

Max open files limit
====================
To use Samba as a domain controller it is advised to bump the values of
openfiles-max in /etc/login.conf and kern.maxfiles over 16384.  If you
are using /etc/login.conf.db (not usually recommended) then be sure to
rebuild it.

Don't forget to add the entry kern.maxfiles=16384 to the
/etc/sysctl.conf file to keep the change across reboots.
