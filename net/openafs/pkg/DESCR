AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc
Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server
architecture for file sharing, providing location independence,
scalability and transparent migration capabilities for data.

IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the
source available for community development and maintenance. They called
the release OpenAFS.
