Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for
the transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal
framing overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does
not specify an encoding format for data frames and can be used with any
data serialization format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol
Buffers, XML, JSON, MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used
as both a streaming transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP
sockets, TLS connections, AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion
as well as a file format for data at rest. A "Content Type" header
identifies the type of payload being carried over an individual Frame
Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine how to interpret a
given sequence of data payloads.

fstrm is an optimized C implementation of Frame Streams that includes
a fast, lockless circular queue implementation and exposes library
interfaces for setting up a dedicated Frame Streams I/O thread and
asynchronously submitting data frames for transport from worker threads.
It was originally written to facilitate the addition of high speed
binary logging to DNS servers written in C using the dnstap log format.
