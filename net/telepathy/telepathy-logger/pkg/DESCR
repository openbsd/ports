tp-logger is a headless Observer client that logs information received
by the Telepathy framework. It features pluggable backends to log
different sorts of messages, in different formats.

tp-logger features a Telepathy-style D-Bus API to expose logs and
interesting information related to logging (most frequent contacts,
etc.). It also provides a GLib-compatible client API for making bulk log
requests (e.g. for display logs in applications without having to
provide lots of information over D-Bus).
