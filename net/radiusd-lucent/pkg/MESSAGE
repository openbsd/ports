+---------------
| The RADIUS configuration files belong in /etc/raddb.  Examples
| and extra documentation can be found in the following locations:
|
|     ${PREFIX}/share/examples/radiusd-lucent
|     ${PREFIX}/share/doc/radiusd-lucent
|
| You will need to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
| section similiar to the following:
|
|     if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd ]; then
|             ${PREFIX}/sbin/radiusd && echo -n ' radiusd'
|     fi
|
| RADIUS accounting information is created in /var/log/radacct. This 
| directory must be created before it can be used.
|
|     install -d -m 700 -o root -g wheel /var/log/radacct
