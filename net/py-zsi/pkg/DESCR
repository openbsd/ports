ZSI, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a pure-Python module that
provides an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in SOAP 1.1
Specification (see http://www.w3.org/TR/soap).  It can also be used to
build applications using SOAP Messages with Attachments (see
http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments).  ZSI is intended to make it
easier to write web services in Python.

In particular, ZSI parses and generates SOAP messages, and converts
between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax. Simple dispatch and
invocation methods are supported.  There are no known bugs.  It's only
known limitation is that it cannot handle multi-dimensional arrays.
