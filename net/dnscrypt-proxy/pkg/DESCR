dnscrypt-proxy is a flexible DNS proxy, with support for modern
encrypted DNS protocols such as DNSCrypt v2, DNS-over-HTTPS, Anonymized
DNSCrypt and ODoH (Oblivious DoH), and features:

- DNS traffic encryption and authentication. Supports DNS-over-HTTPS
  (DoH) using TLS 1.3 and QUIC, DNSCrypt, Anonymized DNS and ODoH
- Client IP addresses can be hidden using Tor, SOCKS proxies or
  Anonymized DNS relays
- DNS query monitoring, with separate log files for regular and
  suspicious queries
- Filtering: block ads, malware, and other unwanted content.
  Compatible with all DNS services
- Time-based filtering, with a flexible weekly schedule
- Transparent redirection of specific domains to specific resolvers
- DNS caching, to reduce latency and improve privacy
- Local IPv6 blocking to reduce latency on IPv4-only networks
- Load balancing: pick a set of resolvers, dnscrypt-proxy will
  automatically measure and keep track of their speed, and balance
  the traffic across the fastest available ones.
- Cloaking: like a HOSTS file on steroids, that can return preconfigured
  addresses for specific names, or resolve and return the IP address
  of other names. This can be used for local development as well
  as to enforce safe search results on Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo
  and Bing
- Automatic background updates of resolvers lists
- Can force outgoing connections to use TCP
- Compatible with DNSSEC
- Includes a local DoH server in order to support ECH (ESNI)
