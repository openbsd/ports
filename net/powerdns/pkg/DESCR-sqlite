pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache
contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope
with unreachable or down dns servers (for example in dial-in
networking).

pdnsd is configurable via a file and supports run-time configuration
using the program pdnsd-ctl that comes with pdnsd.

This package contains the SQLite-backend.
