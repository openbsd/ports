popa3d is a POP3 daemon by Solar Designer.

In order, its design goals are:
1. Security (to the extent that is possible with POP3 at all, of course).
2. Reliability (again, as limited by the mailbox format and the protocol).
3. RFC compliance (slightly relaxed to work with real-world POP3 clients).
4. Performance (limited by the more important goals above)

This port is installed to be run from inetd, which is sufficient for normal
usage. However, it is possible to build a stand-alone version, should you need
better performance.
