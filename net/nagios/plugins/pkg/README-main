Setting up Nagios' plugins on OpenBSD
-------------------------------------

The check_icmp and check_dhcp Nagios plugins need elevated privileges to
run properly. As the code quality of these plugins is not really good,
they are not installed suid root by default.

If you have to use these plugins (note that check_fping could be used
in place of check_icmp), instead of running the whole plugin as root,
it is possible to run them with systrace's privilege elevation feature.
This way the plugin runs as _nagios, but the individual system calls
requiring privileges are run as root.

1) Create a preliminary systrace policy for the plugin.

# cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/nagios
# systrace -A -d /tmp ./<plugin> <plugin arguments>

This creates a policy for the plugin <plugin> in /tmp.

2) Refine the policy and configure privilege elevation as required. This
is an example, permitting the bind(2) syscall as root.

native-bind: sockaddr eq "inet-[0.0.0.0]:68" then permit as root

3) Copy the systrace policy to /etc/systrace.

4) Run visudo as root and configure sudo for user _nagios like this.

_nagios ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systrace -a -c 550\:550 \
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/nagios/<plugin> <plugin arguments>

5) Configure the respective command in nagios.

define command {
	command_name check_dhcp
	command_line sudo /bin/systrace -a -c 550:550 $USER1$/<plugin> <plugin arguments>
}

6) In case of problems, systrace will log to /var/log/messages.
