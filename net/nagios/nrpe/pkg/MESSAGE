This version of NRPE is not compatible with older versions; both "server"
(machine running the nrpe daemon) and client must be updated together.
On the machine running the nrpe daemon, edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/nrpe.cfg - provide
the path to a private key in ssl_privatekey_file and a certificate
(either self-signed or CA-signed) in ssl_cert_file.

Or, preferably, switch to another method for monitoring. The check
scripts in "manubolon-snmp" will let you perform many of the same checks
(storage, memory, load etc) with just a standard SNMP daemon on the
monitored machine.

*** NRPE no longer receives fixes upstream. ***
