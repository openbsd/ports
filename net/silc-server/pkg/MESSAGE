Configuring silc-server for OpenBSD
-----------------------------------

- configuration files are in 		${SYSCONFDIR}/silcd
- documentation is installed in		${PREFIX}/share/doc/silcd
- sample configuration files are in	${PREFIX}/share/examples/silcd

As silcd uses the IANA-assigned privileged port of 706, it is highly
recommended to take advantage of the installed silcd user and group.

If you have not already done so, you will need to generate a keypair:

# silcd -C ${SYSCONFDIR}/silcd
# chown _silcd:_silcd ${SYSCONFDIR}/silcd/silcd.{pub,prv}
# chmod 600 ${SYSCONFDIR}/silcd/silcd.prv

Additionally, you may wish to start silcd at system start-up
via the /etc/rc.local script:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/silcd ]; then
	echo -n ' silcd';	${PREFIX}/sbin/silcd
fi

*********************
* WARNING!
*
* This port has changed its user/group from 'silcd' to '_silcd'. If you
* installed this port before, ensure all permissions are set correctly and
* then "rmuser silcd".
