| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) openfire requires a database.  If you intend on using the embedded
   (HSQLDB) database you may skip to step #2.  If you intend on using
   MySQL or PostgreSQL, instructions are available at:

    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/openfire/database.html

2) openfire may be started by executing:

   ${RCDIR}/openfire start

   as root. To arrange for this to happen at boot, add 'openfire'
   to "pkg_scripts" in /etc/rc.conf.local(8)

3) After starting openfire, you may access the web interface at
   http://[hostname]:9090/; when you first login there is a configuration
   dialog. After enabling SSL, you can use https://[hostname]:9091/
   When creating the admin account, note that the default username
   is "admin", not the email address you enter.

4) openfire's automated setup and plugin installation services require
   several directories to be writable by the _openfire user.  When you
   complete the installation process, you may wish to tighten permissions
   on ${TRUEPREFIX}/openfire and its subdirectories.

5) openfire's DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism does not interoperate very well.
   If you experience issues with client authentication, you may need to
   force the SASL mechanism to PLAIN by adding:

   <sasl><mechs>PLAIN</mechs></sasl>

   as the second-last line of ${TRUEPREFIX}/openfire/conf/openfire.xml
   (e.g, just inside the closing XML tag).

   Then restart openfire for the changes to take effect.
