.Sh NAME

.Nd Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar hostname
.Op Fl -version
.Op Fl -phone Ar number
.Op Fl -nolaunchpppd 
.Op Fl -quirks Ar quirk
.Op Fl -debug
.Op Fl -sync
.Op Fl -timeout Ar secs
.Op Fl -nobuffer
.Op Fl -idle-wait Ar time
.Op Fl -max-echo-wait Ar time
.Op Fl -logstring Ar name
.Op Fl -localbind Ar addr
.Op Fl -loglevel Ar level
.Op Ar ppp options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages
a virtual private network (VPN) connection using Microsoft
PPTP protocols using IP GRE tunneling protocols.
.Nm
uses
.Xr ppp 8
on a pseudo-tty
to negotiate the connection with MS-CHAP authentication.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
uses GRE, the net.inet.gre.allow sysctl needs to be enabled.
.Nm
will automatically try to enable this sysctl on startup.
.Pp
The
.Ar hostname
parameter specifies which host should be contacted as the PPTP server.
.Pp
.Op Ar ppp options
are passed on to
.Xr ppp 8
and typically include a remote username or a file containing options.
.Pp
.Nm
must be run as root.
.Pp
.Nm
accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -version
Display version number and exit.
.It Fl -phone Ar number
Pass
.Ar number
to remote host as phone number.
.It Fl -nolaunchpppd 
Do not launch a ppp daemon, for use as a ppp daemon pty.
.It Fl -quirks Ar quirk
Some ADSL providers and some ADSL hardware are buggy or not conforming
to the RFC, and require special handling.  To this end,
.Nm
supports a 'quirks' mechanism.
Currently, only '--quirks BEZEQ_ISRAEL' is defined, for connecting to
Bezeq (the Israeli phone company) ADSL service.
Only some of the equipment used by Bezeq needs this option, but even
the equipment that does not need it works fine with it.
.It Fl -debug
Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb).
.It Fl -sync
Enable Synchronous HDLC.
.Xr ppp 8
must use it, too.
.It Fl -timeout Ar secs
Time to wait for reordered packets (0.01 to 10 secs).
.It Fl -nobuffer
Disable packet buffering and reordering completely
.It Fl -idle-wait Ar secs
Time to wait before sending echo request.
.It Fl -max-echo-wait Ar secs
Time to wait before giving up on lack of reply. This option
seems to be unimplemented, because the flag can be set but is
never evaluated (look at pptp_ctrl.c) \(em dead, unused code?
.It Fl -logstring Ar name
Use
.Ar name
instead of
.Dq anon
in syslog messages.
.It Fl -localbind Ar addr
Bind to specified IP address instead of wildcard.
.It Fl -loglevel Ar level
Sets the debugging level (0=low, 1=default, 2=high).
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss PPTP on a stand-alone VPN client
This example assumes that you want to use
.Nm
to connect
to a VPN and use the VPN connection as your default route.
Let us assume that the PPTP server is called pptp.example.net.
.Pp
First, edit
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
and add an entry for the VPN
connection. See
.Xr ppp 8
for details on the format of this file.
.Bd -literal
  vpn:
	set device "!/usr/local/sbin/pptp --nolaunchpppd pptp.example.net"
	set authname User
	set authkey MySecret
	set mppe 128 stateless
.Ed
.Pp
Next, you need to configure routing in
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn: 
    add! default HISADDR
.Ed
.Pp
If pptp.example.net does not reside on the local network,
we have to add a host route pointing to pptp.example.net in order to
avoid a chicken-and-egg problem once the default route is set to
the VPN tunnel.
Assuming the standard default route is 192.168.1.1:
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn: 
    add pptp.example.net 192.168.1.1
    add! default HISADDR
.Ed
.Pp
If your default route is not fixed, for example if you connect
to the VPN from many different networks while on the road,
use a script to figure out the current default route and add the
host route to the VPN gateway. For example:
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/vpn-default-route.sh :
.Bd -literal
	#!/bin/sh
        gw=`netstat -rn -f inet | grep ^default | awk '{print $2};'`
        /sbin/route add -host pptp.example.net ${gw}
.Ed
.Pp
Call the script from
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn:
    ! sh /etc/ppp/vpn-default-route.sh
    add default HISADDR
.Pp
Make sure the changes to the routing table are reversed in
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown :
.Bd -literal
  vpn:
    delete pptp.example.net
.Ed
.Pp
Restoring the previous default route in
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown
is left as an exercise for the reader. On a laptop it is usually
enough to issue a DHCP request to restore the routing table
after the VPN connection is terminated.
.Pp
Connect by running:
.Dl ppp -ddial vpn
.Pp
To terminate the connection, kill the ppp process. It creates a PID
file in /var/run/tunX.pid, where X is the number of the tun device used.
.Ss PPTP on a router
This example assumes that you want to configure a router running
OpenBSD to provide PPTP VPN access to a remote network for all hosts
on your internal network.
.Pp
Let us assume that the VPN server is called pptp.example.net,
and that the default route of our OpenBSD box is 192.168.1.1.
The remote network shall be 10.42.0.0/16; we want all traffic to
this network to go through the VPN tunnel.
.Pp
First, edit
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
and add an entry for the VPN
connection. See
.Xr ppp 8
for details on the format of this file.
.Bd -literal
  default:
	set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command
  vpn:
	set device "!/usr/local/sbin/pptp --nolaunchpppd pptp.example.net"
	set authname User
	set authkey MySecret
	set mppe 128 stateless
.Ed
.Pp
Next, you need to configure routing in
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup .
We also load
.Xr pf 4
anchors for the vpn interface here.
More on that later.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn: 
    add 10.42.0.0/16 HISADDR
    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -f /etc/pf.conf.vpn"
.Ed
.Pp
If pptp.example.net resides inside 10.42.0.0/16, we have to add a host
route pointing to pptp.example.net in order to avoid a chicken-and-egg
problem once packets to 10.42.0.0/16 are routed through the tunnel.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn: 
    add pptp.example.net 192.168.1.1
    add 10.42.0.0/16 HISADDR
    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -f /etc/pf.conf.vpn"
.Ed
.Pp
If your default route is not fixed, for example if your ISP does not
always assign the same gateway to you, use a script to figure out
the current default route and add the host route to the VPN gateway.
For example:
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/vpn-default-route.sh :
.Bd -literal
	#!/bin/sh
        gw=`netstat -rn -f inet | grep ^default | awk '{print $2};'`
        /sbin/route add -host pptp.example.net ${gw}
.Ed
.Pp
Call the script from
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup :
.Bd -literal
  vpn:
    ! sh /etc/ppp/vpn-default-route.sh
    add 10.42.0.0/16 HISADDR
    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -f /etc/pf.conf.vpn"
.Pp
Make sure the changes to the routing table are
reversed when the VPN connection drops:
.Pp
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown:
.Bd -literal
  vpn:
    ! sh -c "/sbin/pfctl -a vpn -F all"
    delete 10.42.0.0/16
    delete pptp.example.net
.Ed
.Pp
To make
.Xr pf 4
aware of the vpn anchors, put these lines into the
NAT and Filter sections of
.Pa /etc/pf.conf ,
respectively:
.Bd -literal
  nat-anchor	vpn
  anchor	vpn
.Ed
.Pp
See
.Xr pf.conf 5
for details on the format of this file.
.Pp
Now define vpn anchor rules in
.Pa /etc/pf.conf.vpn ,
for example:
.Bd -literal
  int_if=xl0
  vpn_if=tun0

  # NAT is of course optional. The remote network needs
  # a route to our network as well if we don't do NAT.
  nat on $vpn_if from $int_if:network to any -> ($vpn_if)

  block drop on $vpn_if
  pass out on $vpn_if 

  # Allow ping from remote, and explicitly make sure our replies are
  # routed back through the tunnel.
  pass in on $vpn_if reply-to ($vpn_if pptp.example.net) \e
	inet proto icmp icmp-type echoreq keep state

  # Same for ssh.
  pass in on $vpn_if reply-to ($vpn_if pptp.example.net) proto tcp \e
	from any to ($vpn_if) port ssh flags S/SA keep state
.Ed
.Pp
Connect by running:
.Dl ppp -unit0 -ddial vpn
.Pp
The -unit0 option makes sure ppp configures tun0 as the VPN
connection end point, and not some other tun device.
The packet filter rules configured above assume tun0 as the
VPN connection end point.
.Pp
To terminate the connection, kill the ppp process. It creates a PID
file in /var/run/tunX.pid, where X is the number of the tun device used.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /var/run/pptp/<ip-address>
is created as a socket.  It is used for communicating with an existing
PPTP call manager for a given remote server host.
.Sh CAVEATS
The PPTP protocol is insecure.
