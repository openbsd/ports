Upgrading from Icinga 1.x
=========================

Icinga2 is not a drop-in replacement for Icinga (or Nagios)!

Read the "Migration from Icinga 1.x" and the "Differences between Icinga
1.x and 2" sections in the documentation.

A migration script exists (see the "icinga2-migration" package), but it
has several limitations (see the Known Caveats section in the information
at https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2-migration). In most cases it would
be better to write a new configuration based on your existing one, rather
than try to migrate via the script.


Getting Started
===============

The following sections only consider details relating to use of Icinga 2
on OpenBSD. Consult the main documentation for Icinga2 which is available
in ${LOCALBASE}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown or online at
http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc.

The included sample configuration carries out some simple checks
on the local machine; these should work as-is.

You may check your configuration file format before starting Icinga:

   # su -m _icinga -c "${LOCALBASE}/sbin/icinga2 daemon -C"

This will parse all configuration files and warn about any problems
which have been identified.

Enable icinga2 at boot and start it as usual:

   # rcctl enable icinga2
   # rcctl start icinga2

Web User Interface
==================

The optional Icinga Web 2 user interface can be installed separately,

   # pkg_add icingaweb2

Consult the upstream documentation and the separate pkg-readme for
Icinga Web 2.

It is also possible to use Icinga 2 with the legacy CGI interface,
or with Icinga Web 1, however this has not been tested by the maintainer.
