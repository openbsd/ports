Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons.

Icinga 2 is a parallel development branch to Icinga 1. Written from
scratch, it builds on the success of Icinga 1 and deals with shortcomings
inherited from Nagios as a fork.

* Easy to install with soft link activation of functions and packages
* Multithreaded and very fast: Capable of thousands of checks per second
* Intuitive to configure, using new object-based, template-driven format
* Easy to extend with native support for Livestatus and Graphite
* Cluster-enabled for distributed monitoring out of the box
