Pidgin is a GTK+-based multi-protocol instant messaging client. It is
compatible with IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise, and Zephyr
networks.

Pidgin supports many features of the various networks, such as file
transfer, away messages, typing notification. It also goes beyond that
and provides many unique features. A few popular features are Buddy
Pounces, which give the ability to notify you, send a message, play a
sound, or run a program when a specific buddy goes away, signs online,
or returns from idle; and plugins, consisting of text replacement, a
buddy ticker, extended message notification, iconify on away, and more.

Pidgin integrates well with GNOME and KDE's system trays.  This allows
you to work with Pidgin without requiring the buddy list window to
be up at all times.
