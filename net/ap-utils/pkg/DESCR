Wireless Access Point Utilites for Unix

This is a set of utilites to configure and monitor Wireless Access Points
under Unix using SNMP. This package includes three utilities:

ap-mrtg		- to get stats from AP and return it in MRTG format;
ap-trapd	- to receive, parse and log trap messages from AP;
ap-config	- to configure and get stats from Atmel-MIB based
		  APs and devices that support IEEE 802.11 MIB and
		  NWN DOT11EXT MIB;

Supported Hardware

ap-utils probably works with all Access Points based on the Atmel chipset.
It may also work with APs with IEEE 802.11 MIB and NWN DOT11EXT MIB support,
such as Compex WP11.
