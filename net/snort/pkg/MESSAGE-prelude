An up-to-date set of rules is needed for Snort to be useful as an IDS.
These can be downloaded manually or net/oinkmaster can be used to
download the latest rules from several different sources.

To start with snort as sensor for prelude, you have to create a
starting profile, e.g. "snort" by running on the manager side:

# prelude-adduser registration-server prelude-manager \
	--uid=564 --gid=564

and on the sensor side:

# prelude-adduser register snort "idmef:w" \
	<manager address> --uid 557 --gid 557

Then, fill in the prelude section in ${SYSCONFDIR}/snort/snort.conf
before starting snort (the name of the profile is "snort" in the
example).

Eventually, you should start snort with the following options:

    -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -u _snort -g _snort -l /var/snort/log
