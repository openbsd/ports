An up-to-date set of rules is needed for Snort to be useful as an IDS.
These can be downloaded manually or net/oinkmaster can be used to
download the latest rules from several different sources.

It is recommended that snort be run as an unprivileged chrooted user.
A _snort user/group and a log directory have been created for this
purpose. You should start snort with the following options to take
advantage of this:

  -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -u _snort -g _snort -t /var/snort -l /var/snort/log
