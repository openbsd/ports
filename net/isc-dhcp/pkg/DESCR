The ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides a freely
redistributable reference implementation of all aspects of the DHCP
protocol, through a suite of DHCP tools:

- A DHCP server
- A DHCP client
- A DHCP relay agent

These tools all use a modular API which is designed to be sufficiently
general that it can easily be made to work on POSIX-compliant operating
systems and also non-POSIX systems like Windows NT and MacOS.

The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided both as reference
implementations of the protocol and as working, fully-featured sample
implementations. Both the client and the server provide functionality
that, while not strictly required by the protocol, is very useful in
practice. The DHCP server also makes allowances for non-compliant clients
which one might still like to support.
