Open Source, self-hosted implementation of the Tailscale control server.

The control server works as an exchange point of Wireguard public keys for the
nodes in the Tailscale network. It also assigns the IP addresses of the
clients, creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines
between users, and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.

Headscale implements this coordination server.
