dnstop is a libpcap application (a la tcpdump) that displays
various tables of DNS traffic on your network. Currently dnstop
displays tables of:

    * Source IP addresses
    * Destination IP addresses
    * Query types
    * Response codes
    * Opcodes
    * Top level domains
    * Second level domains
    * Third level domains
    * etc...

dnstop supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

To help find especially undesirable DNS queries, dnstop provides a
number of filters. The filters tell dnstop to display only the following
types of queries:

    * For unknown/invalid TLDs
    * A queries where the query name is already an IP address
    * PTR queries for RFC1918 address space
