from Nergal's README:

	Libnids is a library that provides a functionality of one of NIDS
(Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component. It means
that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams
a bit (quite a bit ;)), and provides convinient information on them to
analyzing modules of NIDS. Libnids performs:
a) assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams
b) IP defragmentation
c) TCP port scan detection
