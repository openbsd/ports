A pure Python network address representation and manipulation library.

netaddr provides a Pythonic way of working with :-

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets
MAC addresses, OUI and IAB identifiers, IEEE EUI-64 identifiers
arbitrary (non-aligned) IP address ranges and IP address sets
various non-CIDR IP range formats such as nmap and glob-style formats

An interactive shell ("netaddr") is also available; ipython must be
available to use it.
