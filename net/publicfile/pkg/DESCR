publicfile supplies files to the public through HTTP and FTP. 

Security features: 

- Before accepting any commands, publicfile chroot()s to the public file
  area and sheds root privileges.
- publicfile doesn't let users log in. Intruders can't use publicfile to
  check your usernames and passwords.
- publicfile refuses to supply files that are unreadable to owner, unreadable
  to group, or unreadable to world.
- publicfile never attempts to modify the public file area. It refuses all
  HTTP and FTP modification commands.
- publicfile never runs any other programs. It does not support HTTP CGI or
  FTP SITE EXEC.
- publicfile avoids bug-prone libraries such as stdio.
- The publicfile FTP server uses local ports above 1024 for PORT connections.
- The publicfile FTP server prohibits remote ports below 1024 for PORT.
- The publicfile FTP server prohibits PORT relaying.
