Ices version 0.x is a source client for streaming MP3 audio to Shoutcast,
Icecast v1 and v2 servers. Due to Perl being shipped on OpenBSD by
default, custom playlist handlers written in Perl are always supported
by this port. Input files understood by Ices include MP3, Ogg Vorbis and
FLAC.

Flavors:

  python      - support custom playlist handlers written in Python
  mp4         - add support for transcoding MP4 (AAC) files
