The OpenBGPD performance test suite contains two applications for
performance measurements.

The bgp-blaster tool can load mrtdump files into a table and emulate
many peers using that table.

The bgp-canary tool sends special UPDATE messages to the system under
test and measures the latency through the system. The statistics for
these measurements are available as an openmetric file.
