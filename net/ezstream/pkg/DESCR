Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming
servers.

In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data from
standard input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU
resources. It can also use various external decoders and encoders to
reencode from one format to another, and stream the result to an Icecast
server. Additional features include scriptable playlist and metadata
handling. All of its features make ezstream a very flexible source
client.

Supported media formats for streaming are MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg
Theora. Metadata is supported through TagLib, which can read information
from many media file formats.
