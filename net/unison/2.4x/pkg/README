| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unison uses native OCaml marshalling in its prococol. This
means that unison might not work when the OCaml versions of
two instances are out of sync. Assuming that both ends are
OpenBSD and under control by the user, pkg_add(1) can be used
to sync unison and ocaml.

Another way to work around this limitation of unison is to use
the OPAM OCaml package manager to build unison with the same
version of the OCaml compiler on all machines:

doas pkg_add opam
export OPAMROOT=~/opam_unison
opam init --no-setup --compiler ocaml-base-compiler.4.09.0
opam install unison lablgtk  # To build without the gui, remove lablgtk
$(opam var bin)/unison

Common issue
=============
Unison sometimes reports chown() failures that are actually
failures to change group ownership. This can occur when a user
does not belong to the specified group and is the owner of the
file, or is not the superuser. Issue can be addressed by setting
the option 'group' to 'false'.
