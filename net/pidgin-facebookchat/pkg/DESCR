This is a Facebook chat plugin for Pidgin and libpurple messengers. It
connects to the new Facebook Chat IM service without the need for an API
key.

Currently the plugin can log into the Facebook servers, grab the buddy
list, send/receive messages, add/remove friends, receive notifications,
search for Facebook friends and set your Facebook status.
