+------------
| By default, the configuration files and mib modules for snmpd are in stored 
| in ${PREFIX}/share/snmp.  An example configuration has been installed in
| ${PREFIX}/share/examples/ucd-snmp/EXAMPLE.conf.  Extra documentation has
| also been installed in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ucd-snmp.
|
| To have snmpd start at boot time, you must have an entry similiar to the 
| following in /etc/rc.local.
|
| 	if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/snmpd ]; then
|		${PREFIX}/sbin/snmpd -c ${SYSCONFDIR}/snmpd.conf && echo -n ' snmpd'
|	fi
|
| This will start snmpd and use ${SYSCONFDIR}/snmpd.conf for the configuration. 
| (see snmpd(5) for available options)
