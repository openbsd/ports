Net::MySQL is a Pure Perl client interface for the MySQL database.
This module implements network protocol between server and client
of MySQL, thus you don't need external MySQL client library like
libmysqlclient for this module to work. It means this module enables
you to connect to MySQL server from some operation systems which
MySQL is not ported. How nifty!
