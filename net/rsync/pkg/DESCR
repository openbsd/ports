Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.
It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell,
or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options
that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for
its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent
over the network by sending only the differences between the source
files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely
used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for
everyday use.

    extra dependency, for people wanting to bring files from other OSes with
    more versatile filenames.

To use the rrsync wrapper, python3 should be installed.

# pkg_add python3
