Darkstat is a packet sniffer which runs as a background process on
a cable/DSL router, gathers all sorts of useless but interesting
statistics, and serves them over HTTP. Features:

* Traffic graphs.
* Tracks traffic per host.
* Tracks traffic per TCP and UDP port for each host.
* Embedded web-server with deflate compression.
* Asynchronous reverse DNS resolution using a child process.
* Small. Portable. Single-threaded. Efficient.
