ldistfp - remote identd fingerprinting tool

The program will attempt to connect to the identd authentication service
of the host `host' and will try to determine the identd version running. Then
it will look up the response in a pre-made database and find the appropriate
version line. This information can be mapped back to the distribution and
it's version used on this host. Simple but effective, since the identd auth-
entification service is used almost everywhere and most people don't know about
it's version capabilities.
