Angst is an active sniffer, based on libpcap and libnet,  
providing methods for aggressive sniffing on switched local
area network environments.
It dumps the payload of all the TCP packets received on the 
specified ports. Moreover, it implements methods for active
sniffing. 
Angst currently provides two active sniffing methods:
- The first monitors ARP requests, and after enabling IP
  forwarding on the local host, sends ARP replies mapping 
  all IPs to the local MAC address.
- The second method floods the local network with random
  addresses (like macof v1.1 by Ian Vitek), causing switches 
  to send packets to all ports.
