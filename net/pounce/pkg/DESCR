pounce is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer.  It maintains a
persistent connection to an IRC server, acting as a proxy and buffer
for a number of clients.  When a client connects, any messages
received since it last disconnected will be relayed to it.  Unlike
some other bouncers, pounce uses a single buffer for all IRC messages,
which acts as a queue from which each client reads messages
independently.
