rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.

Local filesystem snapshots are handled with rsync(1). Secure remote
connections are handled with rsync over ssh(1), while anonymous rsync
connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and local transfers
depend on rsync.

rsnapshot saves much more disk space than you might imagine. The amount
of space required is roughly the size of one full backup, plus a copy of
each additional file that is changed. rsnapshot makes extensive use of
hard links, so if the file doesn't change, the next snapshot is simply a
hard link to the exact same file.
