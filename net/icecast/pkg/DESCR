Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg-based
streams like Vorbis, Speex, FLAC, Midi and Theora, as well as MP3 and various
others (even NSV Shoutcast streams). It can be used to create an Internet
radio station or a privately run jukebox and many things inbetween. It is very
versatile and supports open standards for communication and interaction.

Icecast v2 is a complete rewrite of the old Icecast streaming server.
It was designed to be highly efficient and have low memory requirements.
