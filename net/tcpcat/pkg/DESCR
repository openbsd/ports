Tcpcat is a simple program that is like `cat' but it works over tcp
streams to allow you to cat from one host to another.

The most common way to use this program would be something like this:
on host a: $ tcpcat -l 93255 | gzip -dc tar xvf - on host b: $ tcpcat
-h hosta:93255 file.tar.gz

Another good use for this program is debugging network stuff. When
debugging a network client or server you can pipe the output of tcpcat
to a hex dump.
