Kombu is a messaging library for Python.

The aim of Kombu is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible
by providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQ protocol,
and also provide proven and tested solutions to common messaging
problems.

AMQP is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard
protocol for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and
security, for which the RabbitMQ messaging server is the most popular
implementation.
