rbldnsd runs chrooted
=====================
By default, the rbldnsd package will chroot to ${RBLDNSD_BASE}, and the
package will create two subdirectories underneath:

	${RBLDNSD_BASE}/             # rbldnsd chroot path
	${RBLDNSD_BASE}/etc/         # zonefiles
	${RBLDNSD_BASE}/var/         # scratch/work (-w) directory

Because of the chroot(), all paths given to rbldnsd are relative to
to the chroot path (${RBLDNSD_BASE}).  Thus, with this line in
/etc/rc.conf.local:

rbldnsd_flags=-b 127.0.0.1/53 rbl.invalid:ip4tset:/etc/rbl.invalid.zone

rbldnsd will load the "rbl.invalid" zone from
${RBLDNSD_BASE}/etc/rbl.invalid.zone and do any processing in
${RBLDNSD_BASE}/var/

Note that rbldnsd will refuse to start if you do not supply the "-b"
option and an "IP address <forward slash> port number" argument for
binding, as shown above.
