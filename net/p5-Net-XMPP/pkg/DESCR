Net::XMPP is a convenient tool to use for any perl script that would
like to utilize the XMPP Instant Messaging protocol.  While not a client
in and of itself, it provides all of the necessary back-end functions to
make a CGI client or command-line perl client feasible and easy to use.
Net::XMPP is a wrapper around the rest of the official Net::XMPP::xxxxxx
packages.
