Semaphores
==========

The default number of semaphore identifiers should be increased to at least 20:

	sysctl kern.seminfo.semmni=20

Otherwise inetsim will fail at startup with the following error:
"Could not create semaphore set: No space left on device"

Response data
=============

Certain services may be configured to reply with actual response data. A set of
example data has been installed into ${PREFIX}/share/examples/inetsim/data/ .
Depending on the services which are simulated these can be copied over to
/var/db/inetsim/data/ .
