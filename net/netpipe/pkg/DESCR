Netpipes is a collection of utilities which attempts to provide the
functionality of pipes over a network.

It consists of small utilities that perform a single task, such as
listening on a port for connections (faucet), sending data to a 
remote port (hose), or even multiplex multiple streams over a single
TCP connection (encapsulate).
