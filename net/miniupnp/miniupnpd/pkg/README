Before starting miniupnpd(1), a new universally unique identifier (UUID)
needs to be generated for the gateway and "uuid=" set accordingly in
${SYSCONFDIR}/miniupnpd.conf. To do so, either uuid(1) from the uuid
package or uuidgen(1) from the e2fsprogs package can be used.

Many BitTorrent programs use NAT-PMP to request a forwarded port, which
needs to be enabled in the config file. NAT-PMP listens on port 5351,
which should be allowed on the internal interfaces, i.e., in pf.conf(5):
pass in on $internal_interface proto udp to self port 5351

Then the following pf(4) anchor needs to be added:
anchor "miniupnpd"

At last, multicast needs to be allowed on the internal interface of the
gateway. To do so the following line needs to be added to pf.conf(5):
pass on $internal_interface from any to { 224.0.0.2, 239.0.0.0/8 }

Current miniupnpd(1) anchor rules can be checked by using:
    pfctl -a "miniupnpd" -s rules
and flushed with:
    pfctl -a "miniupnpd" -F all
