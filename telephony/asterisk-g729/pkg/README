G.729 codec for the Asterisk open source PBX.

After installing this package, you will need to either restart Asterisk
or manually load the module:

# rcctl restart asterisk
-or-
$ asterisk -rx 'module load codec_g729.so'

You can verify the module has been loaded using the following command:

$ asterisk -rx 'core show codecs' |grep g729

You may also need to add 'allow=g729' to configuration files to
completely enable it.  Review these files:

${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk/sip.conf
${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk/iax.conf

If you have problems with the codec, increase the Asterisk verbosity level
to 3 and use the following command to enable debugging:

$ asterisk -rx 'g729 debug'
