kqueue-backed timer module for Asterisk.

Timing is a fundamental part of Asterisk. It has multiple timing
modules available for various OS. For OpenBSD, the options are pthread or
kqueue-backed timers.

Normally, the pthread-backed timer performs best, and this is included
in the main package.

This package provides the kqueue timer to make it easier for those
wishing to EXPERIMENT with it (possibly on a kernel built with a higher
HZ value).

Use the "timing test" cli command to investigate performance.
