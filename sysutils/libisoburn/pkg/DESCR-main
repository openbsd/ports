libisoburn is a frontend for libburn and libisofs libraries which
enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/DVD/BD
media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW, which do
not support multi-session management on media level and even plain disk
files or block devices.

The price for that is thorough specialization on data files in ISO-9660
filesystem images. So libisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or
any other CD layout which does not entirely consist of ISO-9660
sessions.
