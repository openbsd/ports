Deja Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of backing up
the Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses duplicity as
the backend.
Features:
    * Support for local, remote, or cloud backup locations, such as
      Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, and Ubuntu One
    * Securely encrypts and compresses your data
    * Incrementally backs up, letting you restore from any backup
    * Schedules regular backups
    * Integrates well into your GNOME desktop

Support for Microsoft OneDrive requires the requests_oauthlib python module;
available in the www/py-requests-oauthlib port / package.
