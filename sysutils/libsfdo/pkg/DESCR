freedesktop.org specifications are sometimes ambiguous in their
requirements, leaving room for interpretation. libsfdo tries to follow
them as closely as possible nonetheless, except for cases when doing
so would add too much complexity for no benefit and/or result in
suboptimal behavior. Additionally, libsfdo is much stricter than other
implementations, so it may refuse to process non-conformant desktop
entry files or icon themes.
