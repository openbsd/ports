Puppetserver on OpenBSD
-----------------------

Usually on other operating systems, Puppetserver is bundled
together with the Puppet agent, including an independent Ruby interpreter.
Due to incompatibilities between the JRuby bundled with Puppetserver,
and a few Ruby gems relying on the system Ruby, the
dependencies usually bundled with Puppetserver have to be installed
manually into Puppetserver:

To install these Ruby gems into Puppetserver:
# puppetserver gem install --no-document puppet hiera-eyaml \
	hiera-file ipaddress msgpack facter

You may not need hiera-eyaml, hiera-file, or ipaddress gem, on the
other hand, your Puppet modules might rely on other gems.

If you're using PuppetDB, you have to copy over the PuppetDB termini
into Puppetservers Puppet lib directory:

cp -r ${LOCALBASE}/share/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet/ \
	${LOCALSTATEDIR}/puppetlabs/puppetserver/data/jruby-gems/gems/puppet-7*/lib/
