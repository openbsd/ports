Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration
management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution,
network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes
like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy.

This package contains a set of curated and maintained community-supported
Ansible Collections which are not included in the Ansible core.
