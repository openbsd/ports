PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the
policy that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged
processes.  It is a framework for centralizing the decision making
process with respect to granting access to privileged operations for
unprivileged applications.  PolicyKit is specifically targeting
applications in rich desktop environments on multi-user UNIX-like
operating systems.  It does not imply or rely on any exotic kernel
features.  It is used by HAL.
