Prepare the repository owner and directories
============================================
To allow working on existing mirrors without changing configuration,
the reposync package avoids using a specific username and does not setup
directories automatically.

For a repository owned by the new user "cvs" stored in /home/cvs (as is common
on a standard user's development machine), you can proceed as follows:

# useradd -d /nonexistent -g =uid -s /sbin/nologin cvs
# install -d -o cvs /home/cvs /var/db/reposync

For a new anoncvs server following the standard OpenBSD directory layout,
use /open/anoncvs/cvs instead of /home/cvs. If you are adding reposync to an
existing anoncvs server, simply create /var/db/reposync and chown it to the
owner of the repository.

Initial checkout after preparing directories
============================================
Open the list of official mirrors at https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html
and choose a mirror showing reposync support.

Mirrors listed as "reposync rsync://..." support ssh-forwarding.

Mirrors listed as "reposync -p rsync://" do not, and must use the plaintext
protocol that does not validate the server identity.

Simply run:

$ doas -u cvs reposync rsync://anoncvs.mirror.example/cvs /home/cvs
cd+++++++++ CVSROOT/
>f+++++++++ CVSROOT/ChangeLog
>f+++++++++ CVSROOT/ChangeLog.0
>f+++++++++ CVSROOT/ChangeLog.1
[...]

and wait for it to finish.

Memory limits
=============
The default memory limits ("datasize-cur" and "datasize-max") in
/etc/login.conf may be too low in some cases (especially when many
files have been changed at once, e.g. if the tree has been tagged).
