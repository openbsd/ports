U-Boot is a firmware for embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and
several other processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application code.

As ARM systems often do not come with firmware it must be supplied on
an SD card or MMC device to have a bootable system.

This package provides U-Boot for various boards using RISC-V processors.
