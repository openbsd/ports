GNU Stow is a Perl program for managing the installation of
software packages, keeping them separate (/opt/stow/emacs-21.3.1
vs. /opt/stow/perl-5.8.0, for example) while making them appear
to be installed in the same place (/opt).

Stow may be used by non-root users to set up a private hierarchy
under e.g. $HOME/local.
