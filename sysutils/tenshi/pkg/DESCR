tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more
log files for lines matching user defined regular expressions and
report on the matches. The regular expressions are assigned to
queues which have an alert interval and a list of mail recipients.

Queues can be set to send a notification as soon as there is a log
line assigned to it, or to send periodic reports.
