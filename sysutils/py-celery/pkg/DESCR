Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads
or machines.

A task queue's input is a unit of work, called a task, dedicated
worker processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to
perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker to mediate
between clients and workers. To initiate a task a client puts a
message on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a
worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving
way to high availability and horizontal scaling.
