Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly
into your terminal. It provides lightweight access to Gemini, giving you the
most direct path from your prompt to our model.

Gemini CLI integrates with your local environment. It can read and edit files,
execute shell commands, and search the web, all while maintaining your project
context.

Note that the "--sandbox" knob needs the docker-cli package.
