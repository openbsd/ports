OpenVox is configured in an agent-server architecture, in which a
primary server node manages the configuration information for a fleet of
agent nodes. OpenVox Server acts as the primary server node. OpenVox
Server is a Ruby and Clojure application that runs on the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). OpenVox Server runs Ruby code for compiling Puppet
catalogs and for serving files in several JRuby interpreters. It also
provides a certificate authority through Clojure.

It is a drop in replacement for Puppetserver.
