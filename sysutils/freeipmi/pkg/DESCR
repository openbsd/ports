FreeIPMI provides a library and tools to access IPMI Base Management
Controllers, either in-band (host) or out-of-band (LAN etc), based on
the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.

In-band is not available under the usual securelevel(7) with OpenBSD
but in some special situations it may be useful to run in insecure mode
to allow configuration of the local BMC (e.g. using ipmi-config to
adjust or disable network access or remove vendor default usernames).
