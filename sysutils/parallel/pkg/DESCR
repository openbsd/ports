GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
one or more computers. A job is can be a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users,
a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command
that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input and
pipe it into commands in parallel.
