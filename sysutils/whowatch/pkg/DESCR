Whowatch is an interactive console utility that displays information about
the users currently logged on to the machine, in real time. Besides
standard information (login, tty, host, user's processes) you can see
the type of login (i.e., ssh, telnet). You can also see selected user's
process tree or the system process tree. In the process tree mode there
is the ability to send INT or KILL signal to a selected process.
