wmCube is a dockapp that displays a realtime rotating 3d-object
and the current cpu-load.  The cpu-load also makes the object
spin faster/slower.  You can zoom in and out by clicking on
the app and you can design your own objects or use the objects
that come with the package.

* Objects can have infinite coordinates and lines/planes, your
  computers memory is the limit. 

* If you're running a distributed.net client or some other
  application that keep you cpu at full load all the time you
  can make wmCube ignore "nice" processes. 

* You can zoom out virtually to infinity and zoom in almost
  to the center of the object. 

* You don't have to display the cpu-usage at the bottom of the
  dockapp, let the rotation speed be an inituive way to determine
  cpu-load.  You can invert object speed vs. cpu-load. 

* You can change objects at runtime by clicking the center
  of the app.  It will randomly choose a new object from the
  directory you specified at the command line.
