Kopia is a simple, cross-platform tool for managing encrypted backups
in the cloud. It provides fast, incremental backups, secure,
client-side end-to-end encryption, compression and data deduplication.

Unlike other cloud backup solutions, the user is in full control
of the backup storage and responsible for purchasing one of the
cloud storage products, which offer great durability and availability
for the data.
