| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To allow interaction with vmd(8) for unprivileged users, create VM template
and assign permissions for user accounts. This template will be used as parent
VM for VM instances created by Packer.

For more infornation, see VM INSTANCES section in vm.conf(5) and example files
provided with the package.

Build process steps
===================
1) Create image output dir if it does not exist
2) Create disk image, error out if it already exists
3) Start VM
4) Start local HTTP server
5) Generate installation files from templates in HTTP server directiry
6) Pass boot_command to VM console
7) Upon OS installation, shutdown VM

Optional steps can include communication with VM by ssh(1) and performing
various Packer provisioners and post-processors.

Packer HTTP server and installation files templates
===================================================
Packer starts HTTP server on dynamic port serving files from directory
specified by http_directory variable. This directory can contain unattended
scripts like OpenBSD autoinstall(8) response files and autopartitioning
templates, Linux distributions kickstart/preseed files, etc.

To simplify unattended installation process, Packer vmm builder plugin will
process files in http_directory by recursively searching for filenames matching
the fileglob "gen_files_pattern*.gen_files_extension", where "gen_files_pattern"
and "gen_files_extension" are the template variables, respectively.
If these variables are not configured, by default fileglob is "vm_name.pkr.in",
where "vm_name" is the respecive template variable.

Packer will replace the following Packer template variables in these files:
 {{ .VMName }}   - with vm_name variable
 {{ .HTTPIP }}   - with dynamic local interface address created by vmd(8)
 {{ .HTTPPort }} - with the port, on which Packer's HTTP process is listening

and write new files which names are constructed by omiting
"gen_files_extension", by default "pkr.in".
E.g. if there's a file "http_directory/openbsd.autoinstall.pkr.in", Packer will
process its contents, replace variables with actual values, and write a new
file, "http_directory/openbsd.autoinstall", which can be passed to OpenBSD
autoinstall(8).

Example workflow
================
1) Configure VM template in ${SYSCONFDIR}/vm.conf
2) Create directories for Packer's templates, http server, logs, and output
3) Configure Packer by setting environment variables/editing config files
4) Create build templates
5) Copy ISO images and installation files to configured locations
6) Create base OS image with minimal necessary configurations changes
7) Create and deploy customized images using base OS images

Example Packer templates, autoinstall scripts for OpenBSD/Linux guests can be
found in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/${PKGSTEM}.

Caveats
=======
Provided sample templates are written in HashiCorp configuration language HCL2,
which is considered a beta feature.
