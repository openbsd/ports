The virt-manager application is a desktop user interface for managing
virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also
manages Xen and LXC (linux containers). It presents a summary view of
running domains, their live performance & resource utilization
statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and
configuration & adjustment of a domain's resource allocation & virtual
hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full
graphical console to the guest domain.
