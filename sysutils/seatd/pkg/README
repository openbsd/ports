seatd provides VT switching and device access to clients
using libseat.  It is particularly useful for wlroots-based
applications.

Setup
=====

By default seatd's UNIX socket is only accessible by root.
The OpenBSD rc script tells it to allow access to members of the _seatd
group.  Users of wayland compositors making use of seatd should be added
to this _seatd group.

  # user mod -G _seatd _greetd
  # user mod -G _seatd jdoe

Remember to start seatd before the services that may use it.

Debugging
=========

To debug or report issues, start seatd in the foreground with
a more verbose log level.

  # rcctl stop seatd
  # seatd -g _seatd -l debug
