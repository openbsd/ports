clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a
persistently fast or slow system clock. Given a few time measurements
from a reliable source, it computes and then eliminates the clock
skew.

sntpclock checks another system's NTP clock, and prints the results
in a format suitable for input to clockspeed. sntpclock is the
simplest available NTP/SNTP client.

taiclock and taiclockd form an even simpler alternative to SNTP.
They are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local
area network, without the hassles and potential security problems
of an NTP server.
