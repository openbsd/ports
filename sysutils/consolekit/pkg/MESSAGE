To enable ConsoleKit in a graphical session, prepend ck-launch-session
to the session script (note: gdm(1) does this automatically). e.g.
    ${PREFIX}/bin/ck-launch-session ${PREFIX}/bin/bin/openbox-session

Note that you need a system-wide D-BUS daemon running.
The /var/log/ConsoleKit/history logfile can grow very large after some
time. It is advised to use newsyslog(8) to rotate it.
