Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.
Its main features are:
- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by
  metric name and key/value pairs
- a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support
