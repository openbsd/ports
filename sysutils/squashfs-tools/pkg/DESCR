Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses
zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes
in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
64K.

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead
is needed.
