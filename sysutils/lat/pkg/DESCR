lat stands for LDAP Administration Tool.  The tool allows you to browse
LDAP-based directories and add/edit/delete entries contained within.  It
can store profiles for quick access to different servers. 

There are also different views available such as Users, Groups and Hosts 
which allow you to easily manage objects without having to deal with the 
intricacies of LDAP.
