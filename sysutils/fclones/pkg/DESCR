fclones is a command line utility that identifies groups of identical files
and gets rid of the file copies you no longer need. It comes with plenty of
configuration options for controlling the search scope and offers many ways
of removing duplicates. For maximum flexibility, it integrates well with
other Unix utilities like find and it speaks JSON, so you have a lot of
control over the search and cleanup process.
