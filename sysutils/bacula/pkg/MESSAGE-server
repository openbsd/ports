See ${PREFIX}/share/doc/bacula/README-server.OpenBSD
for more setup information.

Note: If upgrading from a version older than 5.0.0, a database upgrade
is necessary.  Also, Director and Storage Daemons must be upgraded at
the same time, but older File Daemons can be used with 5.0.x.

See http://bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/index.html for Bacula
documentation.
