PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables and
libraries.  In particular, it can do the following:

* Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables
* Change the `RPATH` of executables and libraries
* Shrink the `RPATH` of executables and libraries
* Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (`DT_NEEDED` entries)
* Add a declared dependency on a dynamic library (`DT_NEEDED`)
* Replace a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one
  (`DT_NEEDED`)
* Change `SONAME` of a dynamic library
