sysclean is a perl(1) script designed to help removing obsolete files between
upgrades.

sysclean works by comparing a reference root directory against currently
installed files. It considers standard system files, configuration files
installed by default, and packages files.

sysclean doesn't remove any files on the system. It only reports obsolete
filenames or packages using out-of-date libraries.
