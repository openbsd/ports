Shell Integration
=================

shells/zsh
----------

To enable all support, add this to your ~/.zshrc:

```
autoload _fzf_key_bindings _fzf_completion
_fzf_key_bindings
_fzf_completion
```

_fzf_key_bindings causes zsh to use fzf for things like CTRL+r and CTRL+t,
whereas _fzf_completion makes zsh use fzf for **<tab> completion.

shells/bash
-----------

To enable all support, add this to your ~/.bashrc:

```
source ${BASH_SITE}/key_bindings.bash
source ${BASH_SITE}/completion.bash
```

These two files have the same roles as their zsh counterparts.

shells/fish
-----------

Although the function used to set up fzf is auto-loaded, it can't be used in
the shell config, so we have to source it anyway. Put the following in
~/.config/fish/config.fish:

```
source ${FISH_SITE}/functions/fzf-key-bindings.fish
fzf_key_bindings
```

There is no **<tab> completion support for fish.

VIM Integration
===============

The fzf.vim plugin and documentation are installed at
${VIMFILES}.  That is part of `runtimepath` by default
and will be loaded automatically.

It should be noted that https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim are not the
same files, but is built on top of the files installed by this package.
