Midnight Commander is a file manager for UNIX-like operating systems.
It bears a certain resemblance to John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS.

Some of the features are:

* Built-in Virtual File System: manipulate remote file systems through
  the ftp or ssh protocol or Midnight Commander's own mcfs protocol.
  Browse the content of the tar, compressed tar, rpm, zip, cpio, lha and
  rar archives.

* All of the Midnight Commander operations work with the virtual file
  system, enabling you to do complex tasks.

* Mouse support under X11's xterms.
