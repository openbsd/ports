**
** In order to update /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf, run
**
**    ${PREFIX}/libexec/amanda/patch-system --enable-index --enable-tape
**
** You should check both of these files, verifying proper installation.
** Once verified issue the command:
**
**    kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
**
** You also need to create /operator/.amandahosts, which will contain
** the FQDN of the tape server.  The contents should look like this:
**
**    backup.openbsd.org amanda
**
** The permissions of /operator/.amandahosts must be restricted:
**
**    chmod u=rw /operator/.amandahosts
**    chown operator:operator /operator/.amandahosts
**
