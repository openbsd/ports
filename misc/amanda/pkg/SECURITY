Release 2.4.0 addressed a number of security concerns with the assistance
of Theo de Raadt, Ejovi Nuwere and David Sacerdote of the OpenBSD project.

The backup data is transmitted across the network unencrypted unless you
use kencrypt or IPsec.

Kerberos support was present in 2.4.0, but is absent in 2.4.2.  Rumor is
that the 2.4.0 code MAY work with 2.4.2, but the integration has proved
to be difficult.
Kerberos support should return in 2.5.0.

There is work in progress to use gpg to encrypt the dump traffic:
