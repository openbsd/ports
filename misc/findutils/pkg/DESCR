The findutils package contains programs which will help you locate
files on your system.  The find utility searches through a hierarchy
of directories looking for files which match a certain set of criteria
(such as a filename pattern).  The xargs utility builds and executes
command lines from standard input arguments (usually lists of file
names generated by the find command).

All the binaries are prefixed by the letter g to differentiate them
with the standard applications with the same name.
