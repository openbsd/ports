RPM is a package management system based on top of cpio.
It supports digital signatures, source and binary packages,
complex dependencies handling, complex installation scripts
and a lot more.

It has its own macro language, and is well-spread in 
the Linux world.

The package database is set to /var/db/rpm by default, to conform
with hier(7).
