CD-Rchive is a Qt-based graphical CD creation tool.  It uses cdrecord,
mkisofs and cdda2wav, and has the ability to make data and audio CDs.
CD-Rchive also supports recording data and audio CDs "on the fly", and
mounting ISO images using vnconfig to check that the image is as it
should be.  CD-Rchive can be used to make bootable "El Torito" CDs.
