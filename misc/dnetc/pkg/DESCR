Optimal 24 and 25 Mark Golomb Rulers:

Essentially, a Golomb Ruler is a mathematical term given to a set
of whole numbers where no two pairs of numbers have the same
difference. An Optimal Golomb Ruler (OGR) is just like an everyday
ruler, except that the marks are placed so that no two pairs of
marks measure the same distance. OGR's have many uses in the real
world; for more information about them and the status of the project,
please visit their pages devoted to the OGR effort.
