In November of 1999, Sleepycat Software released Version 3.0 of
Berkeley DB.  The 3.X code line includes major new features, some
of which require a database format upgrade. Release 3 also modified
the Berkeley DB API.  Applications developed using version 2 of
Berkeley DB will need to be upgraded in order to use release 3.X.
