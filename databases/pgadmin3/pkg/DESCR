pgadmin III is designed to answer the needs of all users, from writing
simple SQL queries to developing complex databases. The graphical
interface supports all PostgreSQL features and makes administration
easy. The application also includes a syntax highlighting SQL editor, a
server-side code editor, an SQL/batch/shell job scheduling agent,
support for the Slony-I replication engine and much more. Server
connection may be made using TCP/IP or Unix Domain Sockets (on *nix
platforms), and may be SSL encrypted for security. No additional drivers
are required to communicate with the database server.
