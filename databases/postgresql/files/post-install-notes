Now that PostgreSQL is installed, you should read the documentation and
implementation guides. These can be found at:

	/usr/local/share/doc/pgsql
	http://www.PostgreSQL.org/docs

You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the
text "subscribe" in the message body.

If you build PostgreSQL with TCL support, then you can use the
TCL/TK based database frontend "pgaccess" for database operations.

Add this line to /etc/rc.local if you wish to start PostgreSQL
automatically:

	[ -x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pgsql.sh ] && /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pgsql.sh

If you are upgrading previous version of this port, please note that
database directory has been moved from /usr/local/pgsql/data
to /var/db/pgsql/data.
