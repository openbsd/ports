PostgreSQL is Object-Relational Database Management System.  It
supports almost all SQL constructs, including transactions, subselects,
and user-defined types and functions. Write-ahead logging means
increased performance while retaining data integrity.

The OpenBSD PostgreSQL port build produces several packages:

* postgresql-${VERSION} - complete package
  Contains all files needed for creating, administering and maintaining
  databases, querying and manipulating data in them, libraries and
  header files for database applications development and man pages.

* postgresql-clients-${VERSION} - client-side applications and headers
  Reduced variant of complete package without backend-related files.

* postgresql-docs-${VERSION} - documentation
  Additional documentation: FAQs, READMEs; PostgreSQL manuals in
  HTML format: Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Manual, PostgreSQL
  Tutorial and User's Guide and Integrated Documentation package
  contains all the above documentation.
