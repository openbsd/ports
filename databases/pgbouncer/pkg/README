Running pgbouncer on OpenBSD
============================

Post-installation steps:
------------------------
1. Carefully edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini and 
   ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/userlist.txt to fit your needs.

2. Launch pgbouncer in foreground mode to see if everything 
   is ok:

   # install -d -o _pgbouncer /var/run/pgbouncer
   # pgbouncer -u _pgbouncer ${SYSCONFDIR}/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini

3. Launch pgbouncer with /etc/rc.d/pgbouncer start

Random hints:
-------------
Check /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log if something goes wrong.
