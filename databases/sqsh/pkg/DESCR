Sqsh (pronounced skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced
s-q-shell), it is intended as a replacement for the
venerable 'isql' program supplied by Sybase.

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt, it is intended to
provide much of the functionality provided by a good shell,
such as variables, redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job
control, history, command completion, and dynamic
configuration.  Also, as a by-product of the design, it is
remarkably easy to extend and add functionality.
