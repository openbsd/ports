Zim aims to bring the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is
saved as a text file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to
other pages, and are saved automatically. This tool is intended to keep
track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book.

A "desktop wiki" means that we try to capture the idea of a wiki, not
as a webpage but as a collection of files on your local file system
that can be edited with a GUI application. The main focus is a kind of
personal wiki that serves for all kind of notes: todo-lists,
addresses, brainstorm ideas etc.
