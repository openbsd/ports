+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to produce graphs the py-dot package needs to be installed;
the dependency is not enforced because it requires graphviz which
depends on lots of graphical packages.

Before starting the trytond server, several steps are required.

Configuration
=============
Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf based on your configuration and needs.
The "db_password" and "admin_passwd" MUST be changed.

PostgreSQL
==========
Trytond uses a PostgreSQL database to store its data. Dependency is not
enforced because the database can run on another machine.
While it is possible to use another RDBMS, Tryton is mainly developed
for PostgreSQL.

Assuming you have an administrative account named `postgres', you can
create the 'tryton' user like this:
    # createuser -U postgres --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb \
        --no-createrole tryton

Make sure to set the 'tryton' DB user password to the value of
"db_password" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf.

First start
===========
Start the trytond server:
    # ${RCDIR}/trytond start

Database initialization
-----------------------
There are 2 ways to initialize the 'tryton' database.

1. Start directly the tryton client, then go under:
    File -> Database -> New Database
to initialise your new DB.

2. Manually initialize the DB on the server itself:
    # createdb -U postgres -E UNICODE -O tryton -T template0 tryton
    # trytond -i all -d tryton

When the "Admin Password Confirmation" is requested, make sure to match
the value of "admin_passwd" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/trytond.conf.

The /var/log/trytond file can grow very marge with time, it is advised
to use newsyslog(8) to rotate it.

Modules installation
====================
Several trytond-module packages are available in OpenBSD. Just running
pkg_add(1) is not enough, they need to get installed into the database
itself.
    # trytond -i all -d tryton

This can instead be done directly from the tryton client as well if
prefered.

Upgrades
========
After upgrading to a new major version of trytond, the database needs to
be updated.
    # trytond -u all -d tryton
