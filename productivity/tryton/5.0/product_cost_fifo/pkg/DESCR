The Product Cost FIFO Module add a *FIFO* option in the Cost Method
field of the product form.

The cost price of product whose cost price method is *FIFO* will be
updated automatically when stock moves coming from a supplier or going
to a customer are made. The page `FIFO and LIFO accounting`_ on
Wikipedia gives some information about this costing method.
