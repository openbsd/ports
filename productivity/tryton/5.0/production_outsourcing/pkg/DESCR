The production outsourcing module allows to outsource production order per
routing. When such outsourced production is set to waiting, a purchase order is
created and its cost is added to the production.

To define an outsourced production, the routing must have a *Supplier*, a
*Service* and its *Quantity* defined. Those values will be used to create the
purchase order. The bought quantity is computed by multiplying the *Quantity*
by the factor between the bill of material and the production quantity.
