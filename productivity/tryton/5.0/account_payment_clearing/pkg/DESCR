The account_payment_clearing module allows to generate account move when a
payment is succeeded between the receivable/payable account to a clearing
account defined on the payment journal.

The clearing account will be used for statement lines which are linked to such
payment.

If a delay is configured on journal for posting, a scheduled task will post
automatically clearing moves after this delay.
