Generate certificates
=====================
Before starting taskd you need to generate certificates for it to use.
The procedure is described at
http://taskwarrior.org/docs/server_configure.html but has been somewhat
simplified on OpenBSD:

Generate certificate files
--------------------------
In ${PREFIX}/share/examples/taskd/pki/ is a set of scripts that can be
used to generate necessary files. Copy that directory somewhere safe and
adjust vars to your liking.
generate.server will automatically generate certificate with the
hostname and IPs of machine it is ran on, adjust the vars file to
override this.
Once you're satisfied with settings, run:

  $ ./generate


Copy certificates in place
--------------------------
Copy resulting certificates into taskd's directory:

  $ sudo cp {client,server}.{cert,key}.pem server.crl.pem ca.cert.pem \
      /var/taskd
  $ sudo chown -R _taskd:_taskd /var/taskd


Running taskd
=============
taskd by default listens on all interfaces on port 53589. You can change
this with a command like:

  $ sudo -u _taskd taskd config --force server \
        localhost:12345 --data /var/taskd

To enable automatic startup on boot for taskd, add it to pkg_scripts
in ${BASESYSCONFDIR}/rc.conf.local, for example:

   pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} taskd"

To start taskd, reboot or start it manually:

   $ sudo /etc/rc.d/taskd start


Adding users
============
As described at http://taskwarrior.org/docs/server_user.html

For most operations here you'll either have to

  $ export TASKDDATA=/var/taskd

and run commands with sudo -E to pass that variable to taskd, or run
taskd with '--data /var/taskd' appended to it's options. Both examples
below.

Create organization and user
----------------------------
First you need to create an organization to put user(s) into:

  $ sudo -u _taskd taskd add org Public --data /var/taskd
  Created organization 'Public'


Then you can proceed with creating a user:

  $ sudo -E -u _taskd taskd add user 'Public' 'First Last'
  New user key: cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294
  Created user 'First Last' for organization 'Public'


Create user certificate
-----------------------
Go again to the directory where you copied the pki scripts, and run:

  $ ./generate.client first_last

This will generate a new key and cert, named first_last.cert.pem and
first_last.key.pem. It is not important that 'first_last' was used here,
just that it is something unique, and valid for use in a file name.


Configure taskwarrior
=====================
As described at http://taskwarrior.org/docs/server_taskwarrior.html

You will need following information from above processes:
  CA ca.cert.pem
  Client certificate: first_last.cert.pem
  Client key: first_last.key.pem
  User key (yours will be different): cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294
  Organization: Public
  Account name: First Last
  Server:port host.domain:53589

  $ cp first_last.cert.pem ~/.task
  $ cp first_last.key.pem  ~/.task
  $ cp ca.cert.pem         ~/.task
  $ task config taskd.certificate ~/.task/first_last.cert.pem
  $ task config taskd.key         ~/.task/first_last.key.pem
  $ task config taskd.ca          ~/.task/ca.cert.pem
  $ task config taskd.server      host.domain:53589
  $ task config taskd.credentials 'Public/First Last/cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294'


Syncing Taskwarrior
===================
As described at http://taskwarrior.org/docs/server_sync.html

First time sync is special, and needs to be done only once:

  $ task sync init
  Please confirm that you wish to upload all your pending tasks to the
  Task Server (yes/no) yes
  Syncing with host.domain:53589
  Sync successful.  2 changes uploaded.


Afterwards you simply run:

  $ task sync
  Syncing with :
  Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.
