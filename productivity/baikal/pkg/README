| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP server Configuration
==========================
Baikal has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../baikal/html /var/www/htdocs/baikal
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Alternatively you can setup a virtual host using the configuration
provided in ${INSTDIR}/Specific/virtualhosts/

Database Configuration
======================
Baikal can work with a MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Support for SQLite3 is included with the main php package; to use
another database, the corresponding package needs to be installed:
    php-pdo_mysql


Post-installation
=================
To finish the installation:
    # touch ${INSTDIR}/Specific/ENABLE_INSTALL
    -> go to http://<hostname>/baikal/ then follow the directions

Baikal administration
=====================
To administer Baikal, point your browser to:
    http://<hostname>/baikal/admin/
