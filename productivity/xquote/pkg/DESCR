Xquote is a WWW ticker symbol quote retrieval program for UNIX
systems using the X Window System.  Xquote retrieves quotes from a
number of net sources. It takes a ticker symbol (stock, mutual fund,
currency) and displays info in a table or ticker tape. The table
data displayed is selectable, and includes price, date, change,
volume, yield, 52 week high/low, day high/low, P/E, dividend, full
name, basically whatever can be reliably retrieved from multiple
sources.
