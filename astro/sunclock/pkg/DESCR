sunclock displays a map of the Earth and shows which portion is illuminated by
the Sun. It can commute between two states, the "clock window" and the "map
window". The clock window displays a small map of the Earth and therefore
occupies little space on the screen, while the "map window" displays a large map
and offers more advanced functions: local time of cities, Sun and Moon position,
etc.
