Gcal is a program for calculating and printing calendars.  Gcal displays
hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar sheets, respectively,
for one month, three months or a whole year.  It also displays eternal
holiday lists for many countries around the globe, and features a very
powerful creation of fixed date lists that can be used for reminding
purposes.  Gcal can calculate various astronomical data and times of the
Sun and the Moon for at pleasure any location, precisely enough for most
civil purposes. Gcal supports some other calendar systems, for example
the Chinese and Japanese calendar, the Hebrew calendar and the civil
Islamic calendar, too.
