+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The KDE4 desktop can be installed using 2 different meta-packages:
    * kde4-minimal, for a base KDE4 SC installation
    * kde4, for a full KDE4 SC installation
They are focused on standard usage; i.e., development packages are left
out on purpose and can be installed via kdesdk and kdebindings packages.
Also, there is a kdegames meta-package which will install all games from
KDE4 SC.


Starting KDE4
==============
Before running startkde4(1), a system-wide D-Bus daemon needs to be
running ("dbus_daemon" needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable
in rc.conf.local(8)):

  # echo 'pkg_scripts="$pkg_scripts dbus_daemon"' >>/etc/rc.conf.local

Then the following line should be added:

  exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/startkde

... in ~/.xinitrc when using startx(1) (console login)
... in ~/.xsession when using xdm(1) (X Display Manager login)


Profile location
================

By default, KDE 4 in OpenBSD looks for ~/.kde4. You can override this
by setting up KDEHOME environment variable, but please note that KDE 3
uses this variable, too. On the bright side, KDE 3 and 4 profiles are
mostly compatible: KDE 4 apps that change storage or config format,
usually create their own copy using the new format in a separate place,
so in the worst case you'll have some settings duplicated and not
shared.


Renamed binaries
================

Some executable files in ${PREFIX}/bin directory were renamed
by adding the "4" suffix to avoid clashes with KDE 3 ones, namely:

  * kdebugdialog
  * khelpcenter
  * kjscmd
  * kreadconfig
  * kstart
  * ktrash
  * kwriteconfig

The third party programs or scripts that rely on "standard" names
will obviously fail. So beware of blind running foreign scripts
(you shouldn't be doing this in the first place, though, if you're
running OpenBSD), the best could happen is that they will tweak
your KDE3 setup instead.


mDNS/DNS-SD support
===================
The avahi-daemon(8) daemon provides Zeroconf support (aka. Bonjour /
Rendezvous) in KDE.

To make use of it multicasting should be enabled, and "avahi_daemon"
needs to be added to the "pkg_scripts" variable _after_ "dbus_daemon":

  # echo 'multicast_host=YES' >>/etc/rc.conf.local
  # echo 'pkg_scripts="$pkg_scripts dbus_daemon avahi_daemon"' >>/etc/rc.conf.local
