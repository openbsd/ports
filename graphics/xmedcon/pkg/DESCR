The project stands for Medical Image Conversion. 
Released under the GPL licence, it comes with the full
C-source code of the library, a flexible command-line utility and a
neat graphical front-end using the Gtk+ toolkit. The supported 
formats are:

Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, Ecat/Matrix 6.4, 
InterFile3.3 and Gif87a/89a. 

The program also allows to read unsupported files without
compression, to print pixel values or to extract/reorder specified
images. It is possible to retrieve the raw binary/ascii image arrays or
to write annimated GIFs for desktop applications. The library could be
used as a framework for your own image formats.
