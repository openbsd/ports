Tgif is an interactive drawing tool that allows the user to draw and
manipulate objects in the X Window System. It's also a hyper-graphics (or
hyper-structured-graphics) browser on the World-Wide-Web. 

Tgif drawings can be converted to a variety of formats, including GIF,
encapsulated PostScript and XBM.
