dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost all
aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely known
video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source tools.

dvd::rip has quite a few soft dependencies. Check "Debug -> Check
dependencies" in dvd::rip for details.  If operated in cluster mode,
only transcode has to be installed on all slave nodes, not dvd::rip
itself.
