libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing
library.  Compared to similar libraries, libvips runs quickly and
uses little memory.

It has around 300 operations covering arithmetic, histograms,
convolution, morphological operations, frequency filtering, colour,
resampling, statistics and others. It supports a large range of
numeric formats, from 8-bit int to 128-bit complex.  Images can
have any number of bands.

It supports a good range of image formats, including JPEG, TIFF,
PNG, WebP, FITS, Matlab, OpenEXR, PDF, SVG, HDR, PPM, CSV, GIF,
Analyze, NIfTI, DeepZoom, and OpenSlide.  It can also load images
via ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick, letting it load formats like
DICOM.
