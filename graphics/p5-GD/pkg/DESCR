GD.pm is a Perl interface to Thomas Boutell's gd graphics library.

GD allows you to create color drawings using a large number of
graphics primitives, and emit the drawings as PNG files.  Other
useful operations include flood fills, bitmap image brushes, line
styling, transparency/interlacing support and horizontal and vertical
text rendering.
