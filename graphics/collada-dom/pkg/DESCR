This package provides the COLLADA Document Object Model (DOM), an
API that provides a C++ object representation of a COLLADA XML
instance document.

COLLADA defines an XML-based schema to make it easy to transport
3D assets between applications - enabling diverse 3D authoring and
content processing tools to be combined into a production pipeline.
The intermediate language provides comprehensive encoding of visual
scenes including: geometry, shaders and effects, physics, animation,
kinematics, and even multiple version representations of the same
asset.  COLLADA FX enables leading 3D authoring tools to work
effectively together to create shader and effects applications and
assets to be authored and packaged using OpenGL Shading Language,
Cg, CgFX, and DirectX FX.
