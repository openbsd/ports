GNU libxmi is a C/C++ function library for rasterizing 2-D vector
graphics. It can draw 2-D graphical primitives, including wide
polygonal lines and circular and elliptical arcs, into a user-supplied
matrix of pixels. Sophisticated line styles, such as multicolored
dashing patterns, can be specified. There is also support for filling
and texturing polygons.
