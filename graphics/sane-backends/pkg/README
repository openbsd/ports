Using sane(7) under OpenBSD
===========================

First read ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/sane-backends/PROBLEMS.

Make sure your user has read/write access to the scanner device
(e.g. /dev/uscanner0) or you will not be able to scan.

* USB
With some USB backends, the OpenBSD uscanner(4) driver does not support
getting USB vendor and product ids. To make your scanner work with sane,
you'll have to disable uscanner(4) in your kernel - see config(8) -
which will allow libusb to claim your device instead. When using libusb,
you need read/write permissions to ugen(4) (/dev/ugen*.*) and the usb(4)
controller (/dev/usb*) your scanner is connected to (consider using
hotplugd(8) attach and detach scripts).

* SCSI
SANE only supports the generic SCSI uk(4) devices.

* LOCKING
Some backends (like sane-plustek(5)) use a lockfile for allowing
multiple access to one scanner. If using such a backend, you must
add yourself to the _saned group or you will not be able to scan.

* NETWORK
If you're planning on using the SANE network daemon (saned) with
inetd(8) as opposed to starting it standalone from the provided rc
script, add the following line in /etc/services:
sane-port	6566/tcp	saned	# SANE network scanner daemon
