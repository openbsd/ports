VA-API (Video Acceleration API) user mode driver for Intel GEN Graphics family

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which provides access to
graphics hardware acceleration capabilities for video processing. It consists of
a main library and driver-specific acceleration backends for each supported
hardware vendor.

The current video driver backend provides a bridge to the GEN GPUs through the
packaging of buffers and commands to be sent to the i915 driver for exercising
both hardware and shader functionality for video decode, encode, and processing.
