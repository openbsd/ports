darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it
manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them
through a zoomable lighttable. It also enables you to develop raw images
and enhance them. It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent
existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw
or f-spot).

All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
buffers for display. The full image is only converted during export.
Raw files, high-dynamic range and standard image formats such as jpeg
are all supported. The core operates completely on floating point
values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic
range).
