The primary goal of sxiv is to create an image viewer which only has the most
basic features required for fast image viewing (the ones I want). It has vi key
bindings and works nicely with tiling window managers.  Its code base should be
kept small and clean to make it easy for you to dig into it and customize it for
your needs.
