Enlightenment is a window manager for the X Window System that is
designed to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned
good looking! It is one of the more graphically intense window
managers.

Enlightenment goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful
and appealing graphical shell from which to work. It is open in
design and instead of dictating a policy, allows the user to define
their own policy, down to every last detail.
