| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On i386, amd64 and VGA-based alpha, slim is launched on vt05 like xdm.

If you're on a zaurus you'll have to change this setting to vt01 in
${SYSCONFDIR}/slim.conf.

If you're on an arch which doesn't handle virtual terminals (like
sparc, sparc64, TGA-based alpha or vax), you will have to
explicitely set getty off on ttyC0 in /etc/ttys to avoid input
conflicts:

ttyC0 "/usr/libexec/getty Pc" vt220 off secure
