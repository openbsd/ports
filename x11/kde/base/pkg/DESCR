KDE is a network transparent contemporary desktop environment for UNIX
workstations. It was written by a world-wide network of software
engineers committed to free software development. KDE seeks to fill
the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to
the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. We
believe that the UNIX operating system is the best operating system
available today. In fact UNIX has been the undisputed choice of the
information technology professional for many years. When it comes to
stability, scalability and openness there is no competition to UNIX.
However, the lack of an easy to use contemporary desktop environment
for UNIX has prevented UNIX from finding its way onto the desktops of
the typical computer user in offices and homes. UNIX dominates the
server market and is the preferred computing platform for computing
professional and scientists. Without UNIX the Internet would not be.
But UNIX did not address the needs of the average computer user. This
fact is particularly unfortunate since a number of implementations of
UNIX ( Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD etc) are freely availabe on the
Internet. All of which are of exceptional quality and stability.
