GTK Theme Switch is a small and fast command line utility to switch GTK themes
on the fly. It also has an optional GUI to preview the requested theme and
change the font used with it, an optional GUI dock, and it can install themes
downloaded from http://gtk.themes.org, preview them, or switch to them
immediately.
