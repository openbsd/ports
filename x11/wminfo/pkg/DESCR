This WindowMaker Dockapp is designed to be very general
purposed.  It is capable to display any kind of information
as long as it's in text-format.  It uses plugins (or modules
if you like) to retrieve the information, any script or
program that sends its output to stdout can be used.  wminfo
simply captures this information and displays it row by row.
You can scroll the information both vertically and horizont-
ally so even though the window only fits 5 rows at a time
you can scroll down (by clicking with the mouse in the lower
left corner) and reveal more rows.  Vertically you can scroll
a specific row by clicking it or scroll all rows by clicking
the upper right corner.  

Possible uses for this application is system logging, whats-
on-tv-ticker, news headline ticker, weather info, freshmeat
announcements, stock ticker, you name it! If the plugin
fetches information by http or ftp it is obviously best if
it uses common utilities like lynx or wget for the retrieval.
There are switches in the app that (by default) discards html-
tags and multiple consequtive blanks so that the parsing won't
be such a pain in the *ss :).  Another useful option is to
have wminfo monitor changes in the information and start
scrolling the rows that changed.
