The Gnome2::Canvas module allows a perl developer to use the GnomeCanvas
widget with Gtk2-Perl.
Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gnome2::Canvas follows the C
API of libgnomecanvas-2.0 as closely as possible while still being
perlish.  Thus, the C API reference remains the canonical documentation.
