mlvwm(1) does not currently include any default configurations and it can be
time consuming to create configuration from scratch. It is highly suggested to
use the configuration files from https://github.com/morgant/mlvwmrc as a
starting point and adjust to suit your needs, esp. as it includes configuration
for many popular applications.
