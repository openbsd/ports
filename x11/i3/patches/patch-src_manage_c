Subject: Bugfix: properly react to windows being unmapped before we can reparent
We need to verify that setting the event mask works, and we need
to include StructureNotify to get unmap events at any point in time.

Subject: Bugfix: Render workspaces created by assignments to use correct coordinates
Previously, i3 would send width=0, height=0 to windows which were
put on workspaces created by an assignment (that is, invisible
workspaces, which do not get rendered normally).
