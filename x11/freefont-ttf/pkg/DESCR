The freefont project provides a set of free, high-quality, outline (i.e.
OpenType) fonts covering the ISO 10646/Unicode UCS (Universal Character
Set). This set consists of three TrueType typefaces: one monospaced and
two proportional -- one with uniform and one with modulated stroke.
These fonts are similar to the Helvetica, Times and Courier fonts.
