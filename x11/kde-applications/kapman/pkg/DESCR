Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. You must go through
the levels escaping ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost
eats you, but you can eat the ghosts for a few seconds when eating
an energizer. You win points when eating pills, energizers, and
bonus, and you win one life for each 10,000 points. When you have
eaten all the pills and energizers of a level, you go to the next
level, and the player and ghost speeds increase. The game ends when
you have lost all your lives.
