Kongress provides practical information about conferences. It supports
conferences that offer their schedule in iCalendar format. In Kongress, the
data of the talks are shown in various ways, e.g. in daily views, by talk
category, etc. The users can also create a list of favorite conference
talks/events as well as they can navigate to the web page of each talk. A map
of the conference venue, location information and link to OpenStreetMap can
also be added.
