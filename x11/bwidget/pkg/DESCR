The BWidget toolkit is a high-level widget set for Tcl/Tk built using
native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.

The BWidgets have a professional look and feel as in other well known
Toolkits, but the concept is radically different because everything is
pure Tcl/Tk.  No platform dependencies, and no compiling required.
