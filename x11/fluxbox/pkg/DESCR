Fluxbox is yet another window manager for X. It's based on the
original Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like Blackbox and
handles styles, colors, window placement, and similar things
exactly like Blackbox (100% theme/style compatibility). 

So what's the difference between Fluxbox and Blackbox then?
The answer is: LOTS!
