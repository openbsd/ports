XbaeMatrix is a free Motif® table widget (also compatible with the
free LessTif) which presents an editable array of string data to
the user in a scrollable table similar to a spreadsheet. The rows
and columns of the Matrix may optionally be labelled. A number of
"fixed" and "trailing fixed" rows or columns may be specified.
