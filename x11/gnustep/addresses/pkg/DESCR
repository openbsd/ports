Addresses for GNUstep is a versatile address book application for
managing contact information. It stores addresses, phone numbers,
pictures, instant messaging information, email, homepages and whatever.

Addresses is also a framework that allows access to the addresses
database in a way that is source code compatible with Apple's
AddressBook.framework. It also contains a view framework to facilitate
the construction of applications that use the contact database.
