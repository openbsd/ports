This package provides several theme engines for GTK+2 including:

* Pixmap: A generic engine that renders using pixmaps.
  One theme using this theme engine is included.

* Metal: A fairly complete theme engine that looks like the
  Java-Metal look of Swing.

* Redmond95: A simple theme engine that looks a bit like 
  Microsoft Windows95.
