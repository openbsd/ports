wmbutton is a 64x64 pixel application that displays nine
buttons.  Each of these buttons can be configured via a
configuration file to run just about any application you'd
like to.  Basically, if you can type it in a shell command,
wmbutton can run it.

It is specifically designed to be docked in Windowmaker, or
'Swallowed' by wharf in Afterstep.  Of course, it should work
in just about any window manager. 

You need a ~/.wmbutton file, copy a sample from ${SAMPLE_DIR}.

wmbutton -h gives you usage info.
