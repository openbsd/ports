xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including
loading them from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's
mainly meant for client toolkits, window systems, and other system
applications; currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt,
Clutter, and more. It is also used by some XCB applications for proper
keyboard support.
