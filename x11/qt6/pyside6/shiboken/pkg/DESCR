Shiboken is a fundamental piece on the Qt for Python project that
serves two purposes:

Generator: Extract information from C or C++ headers and generate
CPython code that allow to bring C or C++ projects to Python. This
process uses a library called ApiExtractor which internally uses
Clang.

Module: An utility Python module that exposed new Python types,
functions to handle pointers, among other things, that is written
in CPython and can use independently of the generator.
