Obmenu is a menu editor designed for openbox. It's easy to use, allowing
to get the most out of the powerful Openbox menu system, while hiding
the xml layout from the user.
It also (optionally) installs a bunch of dynamic menus (pipe menus),
such as Gnome menus or a quick-navigator.
You can also use the obxml module to easily write pipe menus of your own
in Python.
