Qt Connectivity aggregates support for technologies intended for
easy-to-use device connection. Currently those are Bluetooth and NFC.

Qt Bluetooth enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.
OpenBSD lacks support for Bluetooth, so Qt provides a stub instead.

Qt NFC enables connectivity between NFC enabled devices. Be warned
that Qt NFC on OpenBSD may need some additional components.

This package contains compiled QtConnectivity documentation.
