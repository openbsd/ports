Qt Data Visualization module provides a way to visualize data in 3D as bar,
scatter, and surface graphs. It is especially useful for visualizing depth maps
and large quantities of rapidly changing data, such as data received from
multiple sensors. The look and feel of graphs can be customized by using themes
or by adding custom items and labels to them.

This package contains sources for QtDataVis3D usage examples.
