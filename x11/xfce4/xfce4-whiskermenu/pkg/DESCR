Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you
open it you are shown a list of applications you have marked as
favorites. You can browse through all of your installed applications by
clicking on the category buttons on the side. Top level categories make
browsing fast, and simple to switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu
keeps a list of the last ten applications that you've launched from it.
