Xcb provides access to the cut buffers built into every X server.
It allows the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line,
or with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers can be
used as holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments,
so any number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later.
The program is designed primarily for use with textual data.
