Parley is a program to help you memorize things.

Parley supports many language specific features but can be used for
other learning tasks just as well. It uses the spaced repetition
learning method, also known as flash cards.

Creating new vocabulary collections with Parley is easy, but of
course it is even better if you can use some of our premade files.
Have a look at the KDE-Files.org page or use the "Download New
Collections" feature directly in Parley.
