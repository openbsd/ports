KSquares is modeled after the well known pen and paper based game
of Dots and Boxes. The idea behind KSquares is to construct squares
by interconnecting the dots on the grid. Up to four players can
play this game together, taking turns. The trick is regardless of
who has constructed most of the square, it is the player who completes
the square that gets the point for it. To win the game round player
has to collect the most points by covering the most area with the
squares of player's own color.
