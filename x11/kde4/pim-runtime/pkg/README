1) We use the SQLite driver provided by Qt, named QSQLITE. Akonadi
   provides it's own SQLite driver, named QSQLITE3; it's said that
   QSQLITE3 behaves better regarding locking, but in reality it just
   makes Akonadi hang sooner or later.

   Because Akonadi data is a cache, it can be thrown out at any time.
   But note that some things rely on IDs in this cache, e.g., the
   KMail filters and account settings: if you re-create a cache, your
   mail folders will likely get different IDs, and thus filtering will
   go crazy. Expire options are not affected, though.

   To tweak database driver used by Akonadi, you'll have to run the
   following command:

     $ ${LOCALBASE}/bin/kcmshell4 kcm_akonadi_server

   The Akonadi server configuration window will pop up. The one we
   recommend is called "SQLite (original)" here.


2) Mail search relies on the Nepomuk indexing. Sometimes Nepomuk
   Storage service goes down and you don't get noticed, until KMail
   says that indexing service is not available. In this case you can
   run the following command:

     $ ${LOCALBASE}/bin/nepomukstorage &

   This will start Nepomuk Storage service in background and, after
   some time (when indexing will end) you'll be able to search for PIM
   data.


3) At the moment, Akonadi framework behaves badly on large mail data
   storage (5000+ mails). This is an upstream issue and could not be
   fixed easily. If you want to help improving situation, start by
   reading source code of productivity/akonadi and x11/kde4/pimlibs
   (in the akonadi/ folder), and use akonadiconsole for monitoring
   what's happening in your system.
