VLC (VideoLAN Client) is a highly portable multimedia player for various
audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as
well as DVDs, and various streaming protocols.

As shipped, vlc cannot descramble DVDs.  There are a few DVDs out there
with no scramble protection.  However, vlc will recognize and use an
installed descrambling library (see converters/libdvd in the ports
tree).
