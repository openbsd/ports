Motif toolkit 2.1

Here is what you might ask.  (excerpted from The Open Group FAQ)

  Q:  What is Open Motif? How does it differ from standard Motif?

  A:  Aside from some different copyright and license statements, both
  Motif and Open Motif share the same functionality and source code.
  The primary difference is the software license for each of the
  software products. Open Motif source code and binaries can be
  distributed royalty free under The Open Group Public License as
  long as the operating system upon which Open Motif is running meets
  the OSI's Open Source Definition. Motif is made available under
  the standard Open Group software licenses and requires the payment
  of source code and royalty fees.
  
Does this answer your question?
I recommend you to visit http://www.motifzone.org for more information
about Motif.

p.s.  Some ports with GNU configure do not know that Motif 2.1 requires
-lXp.  In that case, you need to edit Makefile after configure, or,
hack configure(.in) before configure.
