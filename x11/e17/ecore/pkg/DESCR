Ecore is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that
makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts
and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient.  It's a separate
library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this
job easy for applications.
