Embryo implements a C like scripting language used in various parts of
the Enlightenment project, namely Edje.  Embryo's scripting language is
based on CompuPhase's Small language that was introduced in Dr. Dobb's
Journal in 1999.  Embryo allows scripting capabilities in places that
otherwise wouldn't support basic programming structures such as in Edje
EDCs.
