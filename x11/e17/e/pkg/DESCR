What is a Windowmanager?  Strictly speaking, a Window Manager manages
windows - it is the Window Manager's task to arrange program windows on
screen in some defined fashion, and allow the user to move, resize,
iconify, and otherwise manipulate these client windows, without the
client programs needing to do this themselves.

Enlightenment goes beyond this, not just Managing Windows, but providing
a useful, good looking graphical shell from which to work.  It is open
in design, and instead of dictating a policy it allows the user to
define their own policy right down to the minute and infinitesimal
details; from its functionality right on through to its looks.
