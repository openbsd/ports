Bluetile is a tiling window manager for X based on xmonad. Windows are
arranged to use the entire screen without overlapping. Bluetile's focus
lies on making the tiling paradigm easily accessible to users coming
from traditional window managers by drawing on known conventions and
providing both mouse and keyboard access for all features. It also tries
to be usable 'out of the box', requiring minimal to no configuration in
most cases.
