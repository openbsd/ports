[incr Widgets] is an object-oriented mega-widget set which extends
Tcl/Tk and is based on [incr Tcl] and [incr Tk]. This set of
mega-widgets delivers many new, general purpose widgets like option
menus, comboboxes, selection boxes, and various dialogs whose
couterparts are found in Motif and Windows.

Since [incr Widgets] is based on the [incr Tk] extension, the Tk
framework of configuration options, widget commands, and default
bindings is maintained. In other words, each [incr Widgets] mega-widget
seamlessly blends with the standard Tk widgets. They look, act and feel
like Tk widgets. In addition, all [incr Widgets] mega-widgets are
object oriented and may themselves be extended, using either
inheritance or composition.
