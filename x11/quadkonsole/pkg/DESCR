QuadKonsole is a terminal application that embeds Konsole kparts 
in a grid layout. This saves memory, provides faster startup, and 
makes it unnecessary to align your Konsole windows by hand. 
It also provides a lot more screen real estate, makes navigation 
easier by using arrow keys, and allows all Konsoles to be minimized 
or maximized at once. It only occupies one slot in the taskbar.
