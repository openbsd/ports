OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented,
flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and
more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising
hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D
and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and
other intuitive classes.

This package contains the OGRE demos.
