eXtace is an audio visualization plugin for the X-Window System.  It
connects to ESD (Enlightened Sound Daemon) and displays the audio data
as either a pseudo 3D flying landscape, pseudo 3D pointed landscape,
16-256 channel graphic EQ, multi-mode oscilloscopes, horizontal
spectrogram, or a combination of hi-res FFT with a vertical spectrogram.

All modes are fully scalable to nearly any resolution (within your
CPU/X11 capabilites).  Resolutions up to 1600x1200 at 40 FPS use
typically less than 30% CPU, depending on your host CPU/X11
capabilities.
