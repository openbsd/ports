OAF is the new Object Activation Framework for GNOME. OAF has a
similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA activation library, and
will replace it for GNOME 2.0.

It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
Each server is described by an XML file that defines its
attributes. When querying or activating, one may specify complex
requirements using the OAF query language.
