Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader
that provides access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable
combinations of speech, braille, and/or magnification.
Orca works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive
technology service provider interface (AT-SPI).

Optional Braille support requires installing the "brltty" package.
