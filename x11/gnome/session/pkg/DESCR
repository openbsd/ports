This package contains the session manager for the GNOME desktop.

This is the foundation of the GNOME desktop environment and this package
is also responsible for installing a basic set of GNOME utilities
(window manager, file manager, applets, etc) to make up a minimal GNOME
environment.

Other recommended packages for GNOME include:

	x11/bitstream-vera-fonts - a set of True Type fonts
	x11/gnome/utils - a set of simple utilities for GNOME
	x11/gnome/yelp - the GNOME help manager

To run the GNOME environment, simply start "gnome-session" from
either your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession file.
