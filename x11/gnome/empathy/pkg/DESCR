Empathy is a messaging program which supports text, voice, and video
chat and file transfers over many different protocols. You can tell it
about your accounts on all those services and do all your chatting
within one application.

Empathy uses Telepathy for protocol support and has a user interface
based on Gossip. Empathy is the default chat client in current versions
of GNOME, making it easier for other GNOME applications to integrate
collaboration functionality using Telepathy.
