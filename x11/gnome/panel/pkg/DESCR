gnome-panel contains the GNOME panel, the libpanel-applet library and
several applets:

  * the GNOME panel is the area on your desktop from which you can run
    applications and applets, and perform other tasks.

  * the libpanel-applet library allows to develop small applications
    which may be embedded in the panel. These are called applets.
    Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.

  * the applets supplied here include the Workspace Switcher, the Window
    List, the Window Selector, the Notification Area, the Clock and the
    infamous 'Wanda the Fish'.
