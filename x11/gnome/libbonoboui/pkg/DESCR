The Bonobo UI Library provides UI code for Bonobo, the Object Activation
Framework for GNOME 2. Bonobo has a similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME
1.x CORBA activation library, and will replace it for GNOME 2.0. It
allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba. Each
server is described by an XML file that defines its attributes. When
querying or activating, you can specify complex requirements using the
OAF query language.
