Tracker (named meta-tracker on OpenBSD to prevent conflict with the
audio/tracker port) is a search engine, search tool and metadata storage system.

It allows you to find the proverbial needle in your computer's haystack as well
as providing a one stop solution to the organisation, storage and categorisation
of your data.
