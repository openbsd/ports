gnome-keyring is a program that keep password and other secrets for
users. It is run as a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
other applications can locate it by an environment variable.

The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
