This is a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's
production release).

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on Tcl/Tk Img
extension (version img1.2.3) by Jan Nijtmans.
