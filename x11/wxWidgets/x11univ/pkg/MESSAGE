wxWidgets normally installs a symlink from wx-config to the config
script which is specific to the GUI library.

OpenBSD supports installing multiple GUI libraries side-by-side, so you
must either call the script directly (eg wxgtk-2.4-config), or set an
environment variable WXCONFIG before calling wx-config.
