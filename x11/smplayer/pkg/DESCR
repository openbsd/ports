SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic
features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features
like support for MPlayer filters and more.

One of the most interesting features of SMPlayer: it remembers the
settings of all files you play. So you start to watch a movie but you
have to leave... don't worry, when you open that movie again it will
resume at the same point you left it, and with the same settings: audio
track, subtitles, volume...
