Graphviz is open source graph visualization software.

Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as
diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications
in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web
design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical
domains.

The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple
text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and
SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents;
or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful
features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts,
tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.
