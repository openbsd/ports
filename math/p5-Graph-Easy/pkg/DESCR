Graph::Easy lets you generate graphs consisting of various shaped
nodes connected by edges (with optional labels).

It can read and write graphs in a variety of formats, as well as
render them via its own grid-based layouter.

Since the layouter works on a grid (manhattan layout), the output
is most useful for flow charts, network diagrams, or hierarchy
trees.
