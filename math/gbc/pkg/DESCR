bc is an arbitrary precision calculator language. Syntax is similar to
C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports interactive
execution of statements.

It can also be used as a simple console-based calculator.

This GNU version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc
implementations and the POSIX draft standard.

This package includes GNU dc, another arbitrary precision calculator.
dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited
precision arithmetic. It also allows you to define and call macros.
