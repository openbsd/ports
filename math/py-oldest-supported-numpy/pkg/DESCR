This is a Python meta-package which used to be used in pyproject.toml
files to automatically provide a build-time dependency on Numpy, with
the version set to the oldest Numpy version supporting the installed
Python and OS (used to create binary wheels for distribution on pypi).

It is deprecated but still packaged to avoid patches in those ports
which still use it.
