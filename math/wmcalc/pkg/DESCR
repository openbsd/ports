wmcalc is a program designed to act as a simple four-function
calculator.  It is different from other calculator programs,
however in that it is designed to take up very little desktop
space.  As such, it can be left running on the desktop at all
times.

It is intended to placed in the WindowMaker dock, or in Wharf
under Afterstep, though it should run as well under any
window manager.  

You need a ~/.wmcalc file, copy a sample from ${SAMPLE_DIR}.

wmcalc -h gives you usage info.

Buttons are defined as:
 ____________________
|       x99          | 	where: x = 1 for Left Mouse Button   
| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9|         x = 2 for Middle Mouse Button
|--------------------|	       x = 3 for Right Mouse Button
|x11 x07 x08 x09 x51 |                
|x12 x04 x05 x06 x52 |	Note: the numbers 0..9 are the
|x13 x01 x02 x03 x53 |        indicators for memory cells
|x14 x00 x34 x44 x54 |        0..9 respectively.
 --------------------

Button Functions:
199	Reinitialize the calculator, and both Registers
        (Clear All).
299	Clear all the memory registers (0..10).
399     Clear the current number being entered only.
x13	Start a program defined by CalcStart variable in
        config file.
1yy	Perform function shown on button.
2yy	Recall number from memory location [0-9] to display
	for calculation,
		if yy = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
3yy	Store Displayed number in memory location [0-9],
		if yy = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
1zz	Hopefully the other functions are obvious from
        their button graphics.
