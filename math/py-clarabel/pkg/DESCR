Python bindings for Clarabel.rs

Clarabel.rs is a Rust implementation of an interior point numerical
solver for convex optimization problems using a novel homogeneous
embedding.

Clarabel.rs solves linear programs, quadratic programs, second-order
cone programs and semidefinite programs. It also solves problems with
exponential, power cone and generalized power cone constraints.

Unlike interior point solvers based on the standard homogeneous
self-dual embedding (HDSE), Clarabel.rs handles quadratic objectives
without requiring any epigraphical reformulation of the objective. It
can therefore be significantly faster than other HSDE-based solvers
for problems with quadratic objective functions.

Infeasible problems are detected using a homogeneous embedding technique.
