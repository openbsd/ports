LAPACK is written in Fortran77 and provides routines for solving
systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of
linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR,
SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related
computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and
estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled,
but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality
is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double
precision.
