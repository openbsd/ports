PLplot is a library of functions that are useful for making scientific
plots.

PLplot can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++,
Fortran and Java, and interactively from interpreted languages such
as Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl.

The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semilog
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots,
bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different
sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
graph.

A variety of output file devices such as Postscript, png, jpeg,
LaTeX and others, as well as interactive devices such as xwin, tk,
xterm and Tektronics devices are supported. New devices can be
easily added by writing a small number of device dependent routines.

There are almost 2000 characters in the extended character set.
This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host
of mathematical, musical, and other symbols. Some devices support
their own way of dealing with text, such as the Postscript and LaTeX
drivers, or the png and jpeg drivers that use the Freetype library.
