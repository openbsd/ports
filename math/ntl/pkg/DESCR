NTL is an object oriented library for number theory, written
by Victor Shoup.  It provides objects and methods for
	- arbitrary length integers
	- finite fields
	- polynomials over fields
	- extensions of fields.

NTL's lattice reduction code is also one of the best available anywhere, in
terms of both speed and robustness, and one of the few implementations of block
Korkin-Zolotarev reduction with the Schnorr-Horner pruning heuristic. It has
been used to "crack" several cryptosystems.
