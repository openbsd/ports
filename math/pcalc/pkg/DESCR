pcalc is a programmer's calculator. It simplifies some operations
(especially working with multiple bases) that are hard work without
this or another programmer's calculator.  Main features:

     o Full math parser, parentheses, add, sub, mult, div, exponential
     o Automatic conversion between HEX DEC OCT BIN numbers
     o Mixing different bases in one expression
     o Definable variables
     o Math constants (E PI ...)
     o Built in math functions (sin/cos/sqrt ...)
