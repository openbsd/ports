The MCL algorithm is short for the Markov Cluster Algorithm,
a fast and scalable cluster algorithm for graphs based on
simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs.  The algorithm was
developed by Stijn van Dongen at the Centre for Mathematics and
Computer Science (also known as CWI) in the Netherlands.

The MCL algorithm is very fast, very scalable, and has a number
of attractive properties causing it to deliver high-quality
clusterings.
