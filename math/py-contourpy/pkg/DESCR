ContourPy is a Python library for calculating contours of 2D
quadrilateral grids. It is written in C++11 and wrapped using
pybind11.

It contains the 2005 and 2014 algorithms used in Matplotlib as well
as a newer algorithm that includes more features and is available
in both serial and multithreaded versions. It provides an easy way
for Python libraries to use contouring algorithms without having
to include Matplotlib as a dependency.
