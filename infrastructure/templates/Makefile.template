# On source code hosting platforms use static tarballs over generated ones.

# looking at the file URL:
# /releases/ -> preferred. Use SITES and DISTNAME.
# /archive/ -> use DIST_TUPLE (use only if there is no release version).
#
# platform: codeberg, github, gitlab, kde, srht, gnome
# account: usually the account or organisation name
# project: the project or repository name
# id: either a tag name or commit hash.
#   Tag names with standard tag formats, like 1.0.1 or v1.0, set an
#   appropriate PKGNAME automatically. Otherwise, set it yourself.
#   "make show=PKGNAMES" will help identify if that's needed.
#   For a commit hash, use the full hash (not shortened), and set PKGNAME.
# subdir: usually ".", otherwise the extracted files are moved to another
#   directory under WRKDIST. Mostly useful for git submodules.
