.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used within the ports tree to substitute variable values, using
the exact same conventions used by
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
Constructs like
.Li ${VAR}
will be replaced with the variable value, according to
.Fl D Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
options.
.Pp
The options are as follows
.Bl -tag -width Dname=valuexxx
.It Fl c
Copy and substitute.
Number of
.Ar file
arguments must be even.
They are paired as
.Ar src1
.Ar dest1 ,
.Ar src2
.Ar dest2 ...
and each
.Ar src
file is substituted and copied into the corresponding
.Ar dest
file .
.It Xo
.Fl D
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
.Xc
Define
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl g Ar group
Change group of destination file to
.Ar group .
.It Fl i
Ignore changes to group or owner that failed.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Change mode of destination file to
.Ar mode .
.It Fl o Ar owner

.Ar owner .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar file
arguments is given,
.Nm
acts as a filter from stdin to stdout.
.Pp
Without
.Fl c ,
each
.Ar file
is backed up as
.Ar file.beforesubst
before the substitution occurs.
