nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended for use
by network and system managers.  Its most basic usage is to determine
the raw TCP (or UDP) network layer throughput by transferring memory
buffers from a source system across an interconnecting network to
a destination system, either transferring data for a specified time
interval, or alternatively transferring a specified number of bytes.
In addition to reporting the achieved network throughput in Mbps,
nuttcp also provides additional useful information related to the
data transfer such as user, system, and wall-clock time, transmitter
and receiver CPU utilization, and loss percentage (for UDP transfers).
