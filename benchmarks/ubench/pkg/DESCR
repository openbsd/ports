The Unix Benchmark Utility "ubench" provides a single measure of
performance for machines running various flavors of Unix operating system.

Ubench is executing rather senseless mathematical integer and
floating-point calculations for 3 mins concurrently using several
processes, and the result is Ubench CPU benchmark. The ratio of
floating-point calculations to integer is about 1:3.

Ubench will spawn about 2 concurrent processes for each CPU available on
the system. This ensures all available raw CPU horsepower is used.

Ubench is executing rather senseless memory allocation and memory to
memory copying operations for another 3 mins concurrently using several
processes, and the result is Ubench MEM benchmark.
