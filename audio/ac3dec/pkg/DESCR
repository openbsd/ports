------------------------ From the README file ------------------------
This software is completely useless to 99.99 percent of users
out there. It is mostly of use to those interested in audio
coding research and evaluating codecs. It could theoretically
be used as a portion of a DVD playback system for unix systems. 
There are issues with DVD encryption and licensing that need to be
resolved however.
