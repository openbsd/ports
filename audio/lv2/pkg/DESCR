V2 is an extensible open standard for audio plugins. LV2 has a simple core
interface, which is accompanied by extensions that add more advanced
functionality.

Many types of plugins can be built with LV2, including audio effects,
synthesizers, and control processors for modulation and automation. Extensions
support more powerful features, such as:
- Platform-native UIs
- Network-transparent plugin control
- Portable and archivable persistent state
- Non-realtime tasks (like file loading) with sample-accurate export
- Semantic control with meaningful control designations and value units
