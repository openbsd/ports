Pd (aka Pure Data) is a real-time graphical programming environment for
audio and graphical processing. It enables musicians, visual artists,
performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically
without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate
sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices and MIDI.
Pd can easily work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable
technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is suitable
for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods
as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects.
