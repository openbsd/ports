Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player. It plays audio streamed from
iTunes, iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime
Player and ForkedDaapd, among others.

Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the
source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way,
synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it, such as
iTunes.
