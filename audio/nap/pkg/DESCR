A simple curses implementation of the napster client,
originally written for windows.

Napster is a great tool for exploring and experiencing
artists and music you've never heard before, using protocol
for sharing MP3 files between users. With Napster, the files
stay on the user machine, never passing through the server.

The server has the ability to search for particular files,
initializing direct transfer between the clients.
