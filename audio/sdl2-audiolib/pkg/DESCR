SDL_audiolib is an audio decoding, resampling and mixing library.

It is a small and simple to use C++ library for playing various audio
formats. It is a thin (-ish) wrapper around existing resampling (like
SRC or SoX) and decoding libraries (like libmpg123 or libvorbis).

Most popular audio formats are supported.
