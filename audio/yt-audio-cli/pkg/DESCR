yt-audio-cli is an opinionated wrapper around yt-dlp and FFmpeg,
designed specifically for audio downloads. It provides sensible defaults
and a streamlined interface for common audio extraction tasks.

- yt-dlp handles all video/audio downloading and site support
- FFmpeg handles audio conversion and processing
- yt-audio-cli ties them together with audio-focused defaults
and a simplified CLI

If you need advanced features like video downloads, custom format
selection, or fine-grained control, use yt-dlp directly.
