GNU xhippo is a generic playlist manager program for a variety of UNIX
sound players. It's been shown to work with mpg123, bplay, s3mod,
tracker, xmp and timidity, and should work with more-or-less anything
that can take a filename on the command line.  It is capable of
automatically deciding which player to use depending on a file's
extension; the defaults are set in a config file. It uses textual
playlist files, which are easily generated with the ``find'' or
``locate'' utilities. xhippo's interface is very loosely modelled on the
``HippoPlayer'' player for the Amiga.
