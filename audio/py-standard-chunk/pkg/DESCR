This module provides an interface for reading files that use EA IFF 85
chunks. These are used in Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF/AIFF-C)
and some others. The WAVE audio file format is closely related and can
also be read using this module.

This is a replacement for 'chunk', removed from the standard library in
Python 3.13.
