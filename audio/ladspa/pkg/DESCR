LADSPA is a standard that allows software audio processors and effects to
be plugged into a wide range of audio synthesis and recording packages.

For instance, it allows a developer to write a reverb program and bundle
it into a LADSPA "plugin library." Ordinary users can then use this reverb
within any LADSPA-friendly audio application. Most major audio applications
on Linux support LADSPA.
