ABOUT:

CDDB is a high-level interface to the Compact Disc Database at
<www.cddb.com>.  The interface is stable, and this code is officially
out of beta.

TO DO (in no particular order, and with no particular time frame):

* LWP interface to www.cddb.com's search form
* DWIM interface (accept all manner of free-form input, and do
  whatever possible)


COMPATIBILITY:

CDDB.pm uses standard Perl modules.  It has been tested on OS/2, MacOS
and FreeBSD systems, as well as the systems listed at
<http://www.connect.net/gbarr/cpan-test/by-dist/CDDB.html>.

If you want to submit disc information to the CDDB, you will need to
install MailTools.  All other features will work without MailTools.


GETTING STARTED:

To build and test this distribution, type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The final test will try to send a sample submission to the CDDB if
MailTools is present.  It expects to find an SMTP host in the SMTPHOST
environment variable.  It will fall back to "mail" if SMTPHOST doesn't
exist.  If neither works, the test will be skipped.  To see why it's
skipped:

  make test VERBOSE=1

Some of the tests (most notably #25) compare data returned by a CDDB
server against a stored copy of a previous query.  These tests fail
occasionally since the database is constantly changing.  Starting with
version 1.00, the test program uses fuzzy comparisons that should fail
less.  Please let me know if there are any problems.

If you're satisfied with the test results:

  make install
