This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C
files. AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing
digital audio samples in a file, and is widely used in film production,
amongst others. AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes
the ability to compress the audio data.

This is a replacement for 'aifc', removed from the standard library in
Python 3.13.
