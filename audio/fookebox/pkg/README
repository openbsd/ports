| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
=============

After having installed the package some steps are needed to setup a
WSGI enabled server for fookebox.

A sample configuration has been generated and installed into
${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini. If you ever need to regenerate,
please use the command below:

	paster make-config fookebox ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

Now setup the application:

       paster setup-app ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

Now run the server:

	paster serve ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

By default a server will now be listening on:

	http://127.0.0.1:5000

Alternatively you may want to use a different webserver to serve
Fookebox, for example py-gunicorn.

For further details on configuring fookebox please have refer to
${PREFIX}/share/doc/fookebox/config.txt
