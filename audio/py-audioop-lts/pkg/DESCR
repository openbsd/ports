The audioop module contains some useful operations on sound fragments.
It operates on sound fragments consisting of signed integer samples 8,
16, 24 or 32 bits wide, stored in bytes-like objects. All scalar items
are integers, unless specified otherwise.

This module provides support for a-LAW, u-LAW and Intel/DVI ADPCM
encodings.

This is a replacement for 'audioop', removed from the standard library
in Python 3.13.
