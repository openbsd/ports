   About
   -----  
   Mp3cddb is a small perl script that helps you recognizing your unknown
   music albums. If you have a complete music album in MPEG layer III
   (.mp3) compressed audio format, but you don't know its artist/title/the 
   names of the songs/etc, you only know that it's a complete album and the 
   files are in a correct order (e.g. track01.mp3, etc), mp3cddb analyzes 
   these files and tries to identify the album using the compact disc 
   database at www.cddb.com. If this database contains information about 
   the album you're looking for, mp3cddb saves all information in a file 
   called "cddbinfo.txt". This information usually consists of the performer, 
   the title of the album and the titles of the tracks. You can then edit 
   this plain textfile, if necessary, insert any additional information 
   (comment, year, genre) or modify the existing. Then mp3cddbtag, a small 
   shell script (also included) processes this file, tags (adds these 
   information to the .mp3 file using the ID3v1 format) and renames your 
   .mp3 files.
   
   Requirements
   ------------
   This system has been written and tested on a Linux system and it
   requires the GNU Bourne Again Shell (bash). This is included in the
   most of Linux distributions, but is also downloadable at
   ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/bash/.
   
   Additional software required:
   
     * a Perl interpreter (http://www.perl.com)
     * the CDDB module for Perl
       (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/CDDB-1.02.tar.gz)
     * the MPEG::MP3Info module for Perl
       (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/MPEG-MP3Info-0.71.tar.gz)
     * the mp3info program (ftp://bimbo.hive.no/pub/mp3info/)
       
   The Perl interpreter and mp3info are likely available in pre-made
   packages for your distribution. If you use Debian GNU/Linux, you need
   the following packages: perl, mp3info. For more information, visit the
   website of your distribution.
   
   Usage
   -----
   First, try to identify your files using mp3cddb. Please note, that the
   order of the files does matter, since CDDB stores the information
   about albums using an identification number, which is calculated using
   the order and the lenght of the tracks. The names of the files are not
   important, as long they are in the correct order (alphabetically). If
   you've got the information in cddbinfo.txt, modify it according to
   your needs, then run mp3cddbtag to tag & rename your files.
   
   Example: 
   
   [bali 00:16 ~/jamiroquai]$ ls -la
