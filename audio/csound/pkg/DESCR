Csound is a sound and music computing system that has its roots in
the earliest of computer software, the MUSIC-N series by Max Mathews.
Csound was originally released in 1986 by Barry Vercoe and it has
been a part of the computer music world since. Today's Csound works
on desktop, mobile, embedded, server, and web platforms and powers
music software and music-making for musicians around the world.
