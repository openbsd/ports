Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata.
It supports ASF, FLAC, M4A, Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg FLAC,
Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack and OptimFROG
audio files. All versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard
ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately
calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be
edited regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams
on an individual packet/page level.
