Squeezelite is a software program emulating a Squeezebox music player.
It requires a running Logitech Media Server on your network to control it
and stream music to it.

It can normally auto-detect the server's address, but in more complicated
network setups you may need to configure it specifically, e.g. by using
"rcctl set squeezelite flags -s <server>". To set a particular client
name to appear, use "-n <name>".

sndiod does not normally allow access to audio from two different user
accounts. On a desktop configuration this restriction is inconvenient -
in that case you will usually want to allow Squeezelite to share access
to sndiod with your normal login user. This can be done by copying (not
linking) .sndio/cookie from your home directory to /var/squeezelite/.sndio.
If Squeezelite is run stand-alone or you don't need to share access to
the audio device, this can be omitted.
