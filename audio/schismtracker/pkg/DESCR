Schism Tracker is a free reimplementation of Impulse Tracker, a program
used to create high quality music without the requirements of
specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel" that
is difficult to replicate in part. The player is based on a highly
modified version of the Modplug engine, with a number of bugfixes and
changes to improve IT playback.
