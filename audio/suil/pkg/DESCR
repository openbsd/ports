Suil is a lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs.

Suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using any other
toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by Suil). Hosts do not need to
build against or link to foreign toolkit libraries to use UIs written with that
toolkit; all the necessary magic is performed by dynamically loaded modules. The
API is designed such that hosts do not need to explicitly support specific
toolkits at all - if Suil supports a particular toolkit, then UIs in that
toolkit will work in all hosts that use Suil automatically.
