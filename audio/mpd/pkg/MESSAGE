A sample configuration file has been installed to ${SYSCONFDIR}/mpd.conf
and MPD is configured to listen on localhost only.

Make sure that music_directory points to a valid directory,
otherwise MPD won't start.

If you wish to have MPD started automatically at boot time,
simply add the follow lines to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/mpd ]; then
        echo -n ' mpd';       ${PREFIX}/bin/mpd
fi
