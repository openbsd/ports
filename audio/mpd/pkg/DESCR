Music Player Daemon allows remote access for playing music (mp3,
ogg, flac, aac, mod and wav files) and managing playlists. MPD is
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network.  It also
makes a great desktop music player and has serveral frontend options.

Flavors

tremor:	Use the tremor integer-only ogg decoder. This disables
	use of flac files in ogg containers and the network
	streaming functionality.
