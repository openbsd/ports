 .SH "CONFIGURATION"
 When ncmpcpp starts, it tries to read user's settings from the ~/.ncmpcpp/config file. If no user's configuration is found, ncmpcpp uses its default configuration. An example configuration file containing all default values is provided with ncmpcpp and can be usually found in /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp (exact location may depend on used distribution or configure prefix).
