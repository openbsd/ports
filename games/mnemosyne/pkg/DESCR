The Mnemosyne Project has two aspects:
 * It's a sophisticated free flash-card tool which optimises your
   learning process.
 * It's a research project into the nature of long-term memory.

The Mnemosyne software resembles a traditional flash-card program to
help you memorise question/answer pairs, but with an important twist:
it uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time for a card
to come up for review.  Difficult cards that you tend to forget quickly
will be scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't waste your time on
things you remember well.

While you use the software, detailed statistics can be kept on your
learning process.  If you want, these logs can be uploaded in a
transparent and anonymous way to a central server for analysis.
This data will be valuable to study the behaviour of our memory over a
very long time period.  As an additional benefit, the results will be
used to improve the scheduling algorithms behind the software even
further.
