WMeyes is a pretty simple application: it sits in the
WindowMaker dock, and a pair of eyes track your cursor.
Actually, the program should work in all window managers,
but then you don't have a dock to sit it in, in which case
you might as well use xeyes. 

The 'time' parameter on the command line affects both the
update time of the pupil moving around, and the time it
takes for the eyelids to open or close.  These two can't be
separated.

The standard method of starting it up under WindowMaker is
'wmeyes -w -s &'.

'wmeyes -h' gives you usage info.
