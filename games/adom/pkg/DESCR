Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game
which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration of
a dungeon complex.  You control a fictional character described by
race, class, attributes, skills, and equipment.  This fictional
character is trying to achieve a specific goal (see below) and succeed
in a difficult quest.  To fulfill the quest, you have to explore
previously undiscovered tunnels and dungeons, fight hideous monsters,
uncover long forgotten secrets, and find treasures of all kind.

During the game, you explore dungeon levels which are randomly
generated each game.  You might also encounter certain special levels,
which present a particular challenge or are built around a certain
theme.

IMPORTANT: If you are a first-time player you should read the 'How to
start' section of this manual.
