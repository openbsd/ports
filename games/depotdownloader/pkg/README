| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The wrapper script of ${PKGSTEM} adds the following functionality:

1. Adds the flag '-appname <name>' which is the name of the Steam app to
   download. To be used instead of '-app <AppID>'.
2. If '-dir <installdir>' is not provided, it will install the depot in
   ~/games/steamdepots/<AppName> or ~/games/steamdepots/<AppId> instead of the
   current working directory.

Note that in some cases '-os windows' needs to be added if the depot advertises
itself as only for the Windows platform.

Further CLI documentation can be found at:

Example:

	$ depotdownloader -appname "salt and sanctuary" -username <username>
