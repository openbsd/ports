Installing Data Files
=====================

You will need an IWAD for lzdoom to be fully functional. An IWAD is
the main data file containing the graphics and levels for Doom. If
you have a copy of one of the original Doom games, or any other game,
based on the same engine, you can copy them to the following locations
for lzdoom to find:

- System wide: ${PREFIX}/share/doom/
- User wide: ~/.local/share/doom/
- via environment variable DOOMWADDIR

See ~/.config/lzdoom/lzdoom.ini for a complete list of locations.

Some known to work data files are:
- Doom 1 (doom1.wad) and 2 (doom2.wad)
- Freedoom (freedoom1.wad, freedoom2.wad)
- Heretic (heretic.wad)
- Hexen (hexen.wad)

If you do not possess any of those, you can install the freedoom
package or use the shareware IWAD which is available at:

ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pc/msdos/games/idgames/idstuff/doom/doom-1.8.wad.gz
SHA256 (doom-1.8.wad.gz) = 58cf6a563b631a47561630afa6276d853c27079342f7969ec3006965da8557a1

Rename the file to "doom.wad" and move it to one of the above-mentioned
locations.

You can find more data files and how to obtain them in the official
documentation: https://zdoom.org/wiki/IWAD

Optional Dependencies
=====================

In case fluidsynth backend is needed the user needs to setup soundfont for it.

Known Problems
==============

LZDoom supports three GL backends (OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan). Some work
better than others depending on the graphic hardware in the system.

In case lzdoom freezes or crashes before you can reach the in-game menu
to select a different backend, you can modify ~/.config/lzdoom/lzdoom.ini
manually and change the vid_preferbackend value:

[GlobalSettings]
vid_preferbackend=0

or try:

$ lzdoom +vid_preferbackend 0

Supported values are: 0 (OpenGL), 1 (Vulkan), 2 (SoftPoly) or 3 (GLES2)
