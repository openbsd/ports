Game Files
==========

To run 1oom, you need the original files of Master of Orion 1. If you
have a CD version, you can simply copy them to your hard drive. If you
bought the game on GOG, download its Windows installer and unpack it
using the innoextract package. You will find the required files in the
'app' directory.

On the first start, you need to tell 1oom where to find the game files:

	1oom -data /path/to/moo/files/

The location will be remembered for future starts.

Bugfixes and Improvements
=========================

By default, 1oom tries to recreate the behavior of version 1.3, the last
official version of the game, including bugs. Bugfixes can be enabled
with the '-file ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/1oom/fixbugs.pbx' option.

Additional UI features can be enabled with the -uiextra flag, and the UI
can be scaled using the -uiscale option. Passing a value larger than 1
displays a larger portion of the map at once than the original game.

AI improvements can be enabled by selecting 'AI:Classic+' when setting
up a new game. This requires running the game with the uiextra flag.

The package contains several tools to modify the game. For further
documentation, see the files in ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/1oom.
