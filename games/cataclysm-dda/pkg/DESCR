Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic
world.  Surviving is difficult: you have been thrown, ill-equipped, into
a landscape now riddled with monstrosities of which flesh eating zombies
are neither the strangest nor the deadliest.  Yet with care and a little
luck, many things are possible. You may try to eke out an existence in
the forests silently executing threats and providing sustenance with
your longbow. You can ride into town in a jerry-rigged vehicle, all guns
blazing, to settle matters in a fug of smoke from your molotovs. You
could take a more measured approach and construct an impregnable
fortress, surrounded by traps to protect you from the horrors without.
The longer you survive, the more skilled and adapted you will get and
the better equipped and armed to deal with the threats you are presented
with.  In the course of your ordeal there will be opportunities and
temptations to improve or change your very nature. There are tales of
survivors fitted with extraordinary cybernetics giving great power and
stories too of gravely mutated survivors who, warped by their ingestion
of exotic substances or radiation, now more closely resemble insects,
birds or fish than their original form.
