This is nethack.  Will you dare explore the dungeon, kill creepy monsters,
and finish the game ?   At least, you're starting with a bonus: a puppy
(or a kitten) to help you.

If you find that game too easy, you may want to try slash instead.

To use nethack with X11 graphics, you will also have to add 
${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/hack to your fontpath, see xset(1) and 
Xserver(1), also /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm or 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit for proper configuration.

The tty with colors mode uses ANSI colors, unless it finds a suitable
termcap entry, for instance xterm-color. 

Flavors:
no_x11
	runs without X11.
qt
	qt2 interface

P.S. This is a very addictive game, with its whole wacky culture. And even
   a newsgroup dedicated to it (rec.games.roguelike.nethack). Don't say we
   didn't warn you !
