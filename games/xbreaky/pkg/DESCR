Xbreaky is a version of the old Breakout/Arkanoid game, written for
X Window syste.

The objective of this arcade game is to break all the bricks with a ball
that bounces off the walls and a paddle that you can move. You start by
firing out the ball from your paddle, which can be moved left and right
parallel to the wall below it. The ball will move and hit the bricks located
above, and when it hits a brick it will fall apart (i.e. dissappear), but
the ball will bounce back to hit other bricks, sidewalls or the highest
wall. If it falls down not hitting the paddle, you lose one life and have
to start over.
