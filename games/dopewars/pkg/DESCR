dopewars is a UNIX rewrite of a game originally based on "Drug Wars" by
John E. Dell. The idea of dopewars is to deal in drugs on the streets of
New York, amassing a huge fortune and paying off the loan shark, while
avoiding the ever-annoying police. The UNIX rewrite, as well as
featuring a so-called "antique" mode which closely follows the original,
introduces new features such as the ability to take part in multi-player
games.
