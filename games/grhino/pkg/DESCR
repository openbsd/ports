GRhino, or Rhino its former name, is an Othello/Reversi game.  What
distinguish GRhino from most other Othello games is that GRhino will be
targeted for experienced Othello players. Strong AI is the main focus
with some additional good, useful features (like an endgame solver) is
planned.  The ultimate target strength of the AI is that it should be
able to beat the best human player at the highest difficulty level.
