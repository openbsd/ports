LGeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer
General. You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn
against a human player or the AI. Things like entrenchment, rugged
defence, defensive fire, ambushs, unit supplies, weather influence
(implemented soon), reinforcements (implemented soon), etc contribute
to the strategic depth of the game.
