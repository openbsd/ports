This is the continuation of the venerable JA2-Stracciatella project.

Jagged Alliance 2 is a turn-based strategy game released in 1999.

The goal of the JA2-Stracciatella project is to make Jagged Alliance 2
available on a wide range of platforms, improve its stability, fix bugs
and provide a stable platform for mod development. At the moment the goal
is mostly to fix bugs.
