* DESCRIPTION
       Xkobo  is  a  single player action game. The play is quite
       simple. Your object is to destroy all the fortresses.  You
       can control your ship by pressing the cursor keys (or mov-
       ing the mouse cursor), and  shot  beams  by  pressing  the
       SHIFT  key  (or  the  left  mouse button). The game can be
       paused by pressing 's' (or the right mouse button).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* REQUIREMENT
       Xkobo requires:
         1) Unix (BSD, Linux, etc.)
         2) X window system (256 colors or greater)
         3) C++ compiler

       Xkobo is known to compile and run under the following systems:
         *  Linux
         *  Sun-OS 4.1.4
         *  BSD/OS
         *  Solaris 2.4 (Sparc)
         *  HP-UX 9.05

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* INSTALLING
       Edit Imakefile (if you need) and run

           % xmkmf -a
           % make
           % su
           # make install
           # make install.man

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
* OPTIONS
       -display displayname
          This option specifies the name of the X server to  use.

       -fit
          This  option  causes xkobo to use the default colormap.
          Without this option, xkobo uses a private colormap.

       -wait value
          This option specifies  the  speed  of  the  game.   The
          default value is 30(msec).

       -doublesize
          This option causes xkobo  to  enlarge  the  size  of  the
          window. But it costs HUGE memory.

       -fast
          This option causes xkobo to use a faster algorithm.   But
          it costs much memory.

       -cheat
          Cheat  mode. It allows any level to be played, does not
          update score table.

       -hiscores
          Print the high score table to standard out, and exit.
