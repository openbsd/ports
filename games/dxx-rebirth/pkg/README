Installation of the Game Data
=============================

dxx-rebirth requires the original game files from Descent I and/or
Descent II to work properly.  These can come from an original CD or from
GOG.com.

The shareware/demo data can be downloaded from here:

https://www.dxx-rebirth.com/game-content/

If using the GOG.com version of Descent I, you must extract the files
from setup_descent_1.4a_(16596).exe using the innoextract package.

The files will be in a directory named app. You must move the contents
of this directory to a directory named ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data

The eaisest way to do this is to follow these steps:
$ mkdir -p ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data
$ cp -R app/* ~/.d1x-rebirth/Data

You can then delete everything extracted from the exe.

If you own the GOG.com version of Descent II, follow the above steps
with the setup_descent_2_1.1_(16596).exe file and using
~/.d2x-rebirth/Data as the directory name.

Music
=====

The MIDI soundtrack requires the package timidity to be installed.

Add-Ons
