XEvil is a 3rd person, side-view, fast-action,
kill-them-before-they-kill-you game. Fight against either
computer-controlled enemies, or another player.
You sinned in life. And now you must pay. Satan pits the recently
deceased against each other to fight for rank in Hell. Your skill
determines your fate for all eternity. This contest is known as XEvil.
