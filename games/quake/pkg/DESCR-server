Quake is a 3D action game, which can be played both single-user as multi-
user. This package holds a binary server for Quake World.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere. The directory
in which you launch quake should contain the following:

./id1/
./id1/pak0.pak
./id1/pak1.pak
./id1/config.cfg

You can optionally also have the following:

./rogue/
./rogue/pak0.pak
./rogue/config.cfg
./hipnotic/
./hipnotic/pak0.pak
