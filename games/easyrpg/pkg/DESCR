EasyRPG_Player is a program that allows you to play games created with
RPG Maker 2000 and 2003. It aims to be a free (as in freedom)
cross-platform RPG Maker 2000/2003 interpreter. The main goal is to play
all games created with them as the original game interpreter (RPG_RT)
does.

To play, you will need to download an RPG Maker game. Extract the game
to the directory of your choice and run EasyRPG_Player inside the
directory containing the RPG_RT.* files.
