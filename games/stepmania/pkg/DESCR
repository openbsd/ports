stepmania is a Dance-Dance-Revolution/Pump-it-up/In-the-groove
emulator.

Those three games are "classic" dancing games, with a pad where
you step on arrows.

The game comes with a few Songs, but more songs are available on
the Internet.

The current version of the port requires a running pulseaudio, e.g.,
something like

sudo ${RCDIR}/dbus_daemon start
eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
start-pulseaudio-x11

before starting stepmania.
