Barony
======
Barony requires the original game files from Barony: Blessed Edition
(e.g. 3.2.x) to work properly.  These can come from the GOG.com or the
Steam versions of the game. The game version should exactly match the
package version.

If using the GOG.com version, you should download the Linux version
barony_blessed_addition_3_2_3_hotfix_1_30730.sh and use the unzip package to
extract the data.

The files will be in a directory named data/noarch/game. You can move
the contents of this directory to the ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/barony
directory for a global install. You will also need to fix the
permissions on the files.

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:
$ unzip barony_blessed_addition_3_2_3_hotfix_1_30730.sh
$ doas cp -R data/noarch/game/* ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/barony
$ doas find ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/barony -type d ! -perm 755 -exec chmod 755 {} \;

As an alternative, the game assets can be placed into a personal folder
of your choice and the game can be launched with the -datadir= option,
for example:
$ barony -datadir=$HOME/.barony

You do not have to fix file permissions in this case.
