Have you ever thought that Tetris is evil because it never sends you
that straight "I" brick you need to clear four rows?  Well, Tetris(R)
probably is not so malevolent, but Bastet certainly is.  >:-> Bastet
stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based Tetris(R)
clone for Linux.  Instead of choosing the next block randomly, this
fiendish program uses a special algorithm to give you the worst
possible brick.  Playing Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!

Bonus points for presenting it to your friends as "just another Tetris
clone"
