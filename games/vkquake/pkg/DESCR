vkQuake is a Quake 1 port using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for
rendering. It is based on the popular QuakeSpasm port and runs all
mods compatible with it like Arcane Dimensions or In The Shadows.

Compared to QuakeSpasm vkQuake also features a software Quake like
underwater effect, has better color precision, generates mipmap for
water surfaces at runtime and has native support for anti-aliasing
and AF.

vkQuake also serves as a Vulkan demo application that shows basic
usage of the API. For example it demonstrates render passes & sub
passes, pipeline barriers & synchronization, compute shaders, push
& specialization constants, CPU/GPU parallelism and memory pooling.
