Io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by Smalltalk (all
values are objects, all messages are dynamic), Self (prototype-based),
NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and futures for
concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and
Lua (small, embeddable).
