Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. For
an introduction to programming in Python you are referred to the
Python Tutorial. The Python Library Reference documents built-in
and standard types, constants, functions and modules. Finally, the
Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the
core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written
in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.
Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing
applications. See the internal documentation for hints.

This package contains the Tkinter module, for using the tk toolkit
in Python.
