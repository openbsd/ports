Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for
maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

- Robust : behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of
  memory.
- Optimal : write programs the best way they can behave and perform.
- Reusable : the same code works in many environments which have
  different constraints.
- Maintainable : precisely communicate intent to the compiler and
  other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading
  code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.


- Simple Language

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your
programming language knowledge.

  - No hidden control flow.
  - No hidden memory allocations.
  - No preprocessor, no macros.

- Comptime

A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code
execution and lazy evaluation.

  - Call any function at compile-time.
  - Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.
  - Comptime emulates the target architecture.

- Performance Meets Safety

Write fast, clear code capable of handling all error conditions.

  - The language gracefully guides your error handling logic.
  - Configurable runtime checks help you strike a balance between
    performance and safety guarantees.
  - Take advantage of vector types to express SIMD instructions
    portably.
