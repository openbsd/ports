Limitations
===========

- Racket's JIT only supports CPUs with SSE2 extensions, ARMv7 or PowerPC CPUs.
  There is a "no_jit" flavor for arm, amd64, i386 and powerpc.
- DrRacket doesn't work correctly with the "no_jit" flavor.
- Racket is slightly broken here and there on aarch64, arm, powerpc
  and sparc64.
- FFI is broken on sparc64.
- Never run "raco pkg" commands as root, even when the commands are suggested
  by upstream. You're going to break the racket package.
- Racket "places" and "futures" (using threads instead of processes) is
  only supported on amd64 and i386.

FAQ
===

Where is the traditional big package of Racket?
-----------------------------------------------

Since version 6, the Racket developers have been working to create a small core
with the minimal dependencies and to divide the traditional big package in tens
of raco packages. The old big package is now just a "distribution" provided by
the PLT group.

The main reason to select the "minimal" version of Racket as the only one
provided by the OpenBSD ports are:
- Ease the development of the port stripping the extra cruft.
- The users can receive updates from upstream without disturbing the stable
  branches of OpenBSD ports with minors updates.
- The users are not forced to use the distribution provided by the PLT group.
  They can create their own distribution and distribute it.
- The "big package" had a very long list of dependencies.
- Probably nobody needs the more than 180 packages bundled with the "big
  package".

I want to install the main-distribution
---------------------------------------

Install racket-minimal and run:

raco pkg install --jobs $(sysctl -n hw.ncpuonline) --auto main-distribution

I'm only interested in DrRacket
-------------------------------

Install racket-minimal and run:

raco pkg install --jobs $(sysctl -n hw.ncpuonline) --auto drracket

Add "--binary-lib" if you don't want to generate the documentation (requires
additional dependencies).

I installed DrRacket but I don't see the launcher. Where is it?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The binaries of the raco packages are installed to a directory in your $HOME
($HOME/.racket/VERSION/bin). For your convenience, this port includes the script
"racket-user-bin-paths" to get the correct path. You only to need modify your
$PATH:

if [ -x ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/racket-user-bin-paths ]; then
	export PATH="$PATH:$(racket-user-bin-paths)"
fi

Where can I find a list of installable packages?
------------------------------------------------

- https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/

- raco pkg catalog-show --all (add --only-names if you don't want to see the
  detailed output).

- Install the raco package "gui-pkg-manager" and run "racket-package-manager"
  (don't change the default package scope in "Settings", it could break the
  installation).

Can I create a port which installs a raco package?
--------------------------------------------------

No. Racket's package manager is not widely tested in systems which mix
different versions of different packages in different pkg scopes. The
integration of raco packages in OpenBSD's ports framework would make future
updates of Racket difficult with no benefit for the users.

You could modify the Racket port to change the default scope and then generate
the raco ports you want. However, the ports wouldn't be included in the
official ports tree and you would need to maintain a few tens of new
dependencies.

segfault / sigbus
-----------------

If your program or Racket itself crashes with a segfault or sigbus, try
increasing the "datasize" (ulimit -d) and the "stacksize" (ulimit -s) in your
environment limits.
