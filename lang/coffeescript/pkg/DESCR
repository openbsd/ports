CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a
gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of
JavaScript in a simple way.

The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is
readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and
tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten
JavaScript.
