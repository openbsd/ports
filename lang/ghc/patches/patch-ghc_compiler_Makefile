Note: -H sets the initial size of the garbage collected heap used
by the compiler to compiled a Haskell file. There appears to be
some kind of garbage collection bug in  the stage1 compiler build
by ghc4.08.2. It manifests itself as non-deterministic seg
faults, particularly in low-memory conditions. GHC will die
inside scavenge_mutable_list() or evacuate(). This only happens
in the stage1 compiler though, and then, only rarely.

It doesn't appear to affect the final, stage-2, compiler.

I haven't been able to work this one out. But, upping the size
of the inital heap prevents garbage collects occuring as often,
reducing the probability of this bug stopping our build. -H80m
was determined experimentally.
