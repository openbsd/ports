SplitObjs just slows things down, and can overrun ulimits. It does
produce smaller binaries though...

Help ghc find libgmp.a

And GHC produces stack_smash_handler() core dumps on sparc 
unless propolice is turned off. This used to happen on x86, but
has been fixed. Someone want to fix this on sparc?

For some odd reason the existing regex doesn't want to remove all *.o
and *.a files from the libraries. Can't work out why.

Touch some things so that 'make fake' doesn't rebuild the compiler

Make stage=2 after everything else, so as to get a working ghci. Unknown
why ghci doesn't work just via .hc files.
