JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
specification version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's
(free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable
on PowerPC of only ~135K, and Intel 100K. However, unlike other small
VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and
includes support for object finalisation, the Java Native Interface
(JNI) and the Reflection API.
