Connecting your web server software to php
==========================================
Web server programs such as httpd(8), nginx and Apache listen for
network requests and decide whether to respond themselves (as is the
case with simple "static" files) or pass the request on to other
software for handling. The web server must be configured to handle
this - different methods are used depending on the server software.

FastCGI: httpd(8), nginx, lighttpd, etc
---------------------------------------
Most modern web servers support FastCGI which is a simple method of
interfacing to many kinds of application server. This is usually the
preferred method of passing requests to php, and is the only method
possible for many servers such as httpd(8), nginx and lighttpd.

The main OpenBSD php packages include php-fpm, FastCGI Process Manager.
This manages pools of FastCGI processes: starts/restarts them and
maintains a minimum and maximum number of spare processes as
configured. You can use rcctl(8) to enable php-fpm at boot,
and start it at runtime:

    rcctl enable php${SV}_fpm
    rcctl start php${SV}_fpm

php-fpm has its own configuration file, ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-fpm.conf
This controls how the php processes are started. The default settings
are suitable for many standard cases, but can be changed to provide
greater control for sites handling high loads or to provide
separation between different php applications by running them
under different uids or in individual chroot(2) jails.

Your HTTP server needs to be configured to pass requests for PHP
resources to php-fpm. See the documentation and sample configuration.
For nginx, see the "FastCGI server listening on unix socket" example
provided in ${LOCALBASE}/share/nginx/nginx.conf
For OpenBSD base's httpd(8) you can use a configuration fragment like:

	location "*.php" {
		fastcgi socket "/run/php-fpm.sock"
	}

Apache httpd
------------
For Apache, the most common option is with the mod_php Apache module
provided in the php-apache package. This is loaded directly as part of
the web server process. Configuration is fairly simple, but in this
case the operating system can't provide memory protection between
the two; therefore bugs in php can potentially do more damage.

Another option is to use FastCGI via php-fpm as in the above section;
you can use mod_proxy_fcgi to interface it with Apache.

If you wish to use the Apache module, make sure the php-apache-${PV}
package is installed, then enable it by creating a symbolic link:

    # ln -sf ${MODPHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules.sample/php-${PV}.conf \
	${MODPHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules/php.conf

To disable:

    # rm -f ${MODPHP_CONFIG_PATH}/modules/php.conf

After making either of these changes, restart Apache.

php configuration
=================
The recommended php configuration has been installed to:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV}.ini.

Modify this as required for your use.

Extension modules
=================
Many language features in php are provided by extensions, which come
in several classes.

- some extensions are included in the main PHP package and are always
enabled; they don't need to be installed or enabled separately.

- opcache is in the main package but must be configured.

- some 'core' extensions with extra dependencies are packaged separately
(e.g. php-pdo_mysql, php-ldap, php-soap, and others) and can be installed
with pkg_add(1).

- various useful third-party extensions from the PECL repository have
also been packaged. Examples include pecl${SV}-memcached (for use with
sysutils/memcached), pecl${SV}-imagick (image manipulation using ImageMagick),
pecl${SV}-redis (for use with databases/redis), etc.

For all extensions packaged separately (and for opcache), you will find a
file named ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV}.sample/(MODULE_NAME).ini. To enable it,
add a symlink into ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV} and restart:

    ln -sf ../php-${PV}.sample/MODULE_NAME.ini ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV}/

To disable, remove the symlink from ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV} and restart:

    rm ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV}/MODULE_NAME.ini

If you have installed a number of extensions and wish to enable them all,
you can use these shell commands:

    # cd ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${PV}.sample
    # for i in *; do ln -sf ../php-${PV}.sample/$i ../php-${PV}/; done

After enabling or disabling extensions (or otherwise modifying php's
configuration), use rcctl(8) to restart php${SV}_fpm or Apache.

Living with chroot
==================
The chroot jail commonly used with PHP on OpenBSD means that only files
inside /var/www can be accessed, and path references should omit /var/www
prefixes.

File paths
----------
Sometimes it is hard to work with file paths in this case (for example
applications with some parts run from the web and some from the command
line); in those cases it can help to create a symlink so that /var/www
from _inside_ the chroot points to the expected locations. This can be
done with "mkdir -p /var/www/var; ln -s .. /var/www/var/www".

Socket paths for MariaDB
------------------------
See mariadb's pkg-readme file for information.

PHP's OpenSSL functions
-----------------------
Functions for making TLS connections usually need access to CA certificates,
and key generation functions may need access to configuration files.
To use these, copy the relevant files into the /var/www jail:

    # mkdir -p ${CHROOT_DIR}/etc/ssl
    # install -m 444 -o root -g bin /etc/ssl/cert.pem /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf \
          ${CHROOT_DIR}/etc/ssl/

As these files are updated from time to time, you might like to add
the above "install" line to /etc/rc.local.

Executing other commands
------------------------
To run commands from inside the chroot using PHP's file execution functions
(exec, passthru, popen, etc) or the old mail() function which executes
/usr/sbin/sendmail, you must either create a statically-linked binary,
or install the relevant libraries and support files inside the chroot. 
Additionally you will need to provide /bin/sh inside the chroot, for
example: "cp /bin/sh /var/www/bin". Again you will want to make sure
that this is kept up to date. (In the specific case of mail, it is
normally preferred to use PHPMailer or similar, and submit the mail by
SMTP instead).
