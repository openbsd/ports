At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program can
do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send
and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols such
as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open raw network
sockets and interact using other protocols.

This package installs a stand-alone binary which can be used for
command-line scripts, as well as an Apache module. It also contains the
pdo_sqlite driver that implements the PHP Data Objects (PDO) interface
to enable access to SQLite 3 databases.
