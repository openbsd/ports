Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for OCaml programs. It also
provides parsing and printing tools.

As a preprocessor, it allows one to:
* extend the syntax of OCaml,
* redefine the whole syntax of the language.

As a pretty printer, it allows one to:
* display OCaml programs in an elegant way,
* convert from one syntax to another,
* check the results of syntax extensions.

Camlp5 also provides some parsing and pretty printing tools:
* extensible grammars
* extensible printers
* stream parsers and lexers
* pretty print module

It works as a shell command and can also be used in the OCaml toplevel.
