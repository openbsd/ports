Poly/ML is a Standard ML implementation originally written in an
experimental language called Poly. It has been fully compatible
with the ML97 standard since version 4.0.

Poly/ML takes a conservative approach to the Standard ML language
and avoids incompatible extensions. It has added various library
extensions particularly the thread library.

The documentation for the Poly/ML Basis library can be found at
<https://www.polyml.org/documentation/Reference/Basis.html> and
includes information on global values and types as well as structures,
signatures and functors. More in-depth documentation can be found
at the SML Family website
<https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/manpages.html>.
