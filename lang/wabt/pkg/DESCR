WABT (we pronounce it "wabbit") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly,
including:

wat2wasm:
   translate from WebAssembly text format to the WebAssembly binary format

wasm2wat:
   the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format back to the
   text format (also known as a .wat)

wasm-objdump:
   print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to objdump.

wasm-interp:
   decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a stack-based interpreter

wasm-decompile:
   decompile a wasm binary into readable C-like syntax

wat-desugar:
   parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter
   (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print "canonical" flat format

wasm2c:
   convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header

wasm-strip:
   remove sections of a WebAssembly binary file

wasm-validate:
   validate a file in the WebAssembly binary format

wast2json:
   convert a file in the wasm spec test format to a JSON file and associated
   wasm binary files

wasm-opcodecnt:
   count opcode usage for instructions

spectest-interp:
   read a Spectest JSON file, and run its tests in the interpreter
