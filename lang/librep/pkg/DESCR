This is a lightweight Lisp environment for UNIX. It contains a Lisp
interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine. Applications may
use the Lisp interpreter as an extension language, or it may be used for
standalone scripts.

Originally inspired by Emacs Lisp, the language dialect combines many of
the elisp features while trying to remove some of the main deficiencies,
with features from Common Lisp and Scheme.
