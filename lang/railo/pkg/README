Configuring Tomcat to support Railo
===================================
Railo is a Java-based CFML engine. It runs as a servlet in a container;
this package is designed to work with the Apache Tomcat servlet container,
you will need to make a few configuration changes to tomcat to use it.
If you have not yet modified Tomcat's configuration, this readme includes
a patch which can be used:

	# patch -d ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf < \
	    ${LOCALBASE}/share/doc/pkg-readmes/${FULLPKGNAME}

Then skip to the next section in this file, "Starting the service
and online configuration".

If you have already modified Tomcat's configuration and need to edit
manually, there are two possible ways to proceed.

1. Insert the contents of ${PREFIX}/conf/web-railo.xml in Tomcat's
${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/web.xml file. This will need to be kept up-to-date
with future Railo releases.

 -or-

2. Modify Tomcat configuration to include web-railo.xml itself; this is
the method used by the patch below, initial setup is slightly more complex
but ongoing maintenance is reduced.

   a) Change the <Context> line in ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/context.xml to read
      <Context xmlBlockExternal="false">.

   b) Add lines after the first <?xml...?> line at the top of
      ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/web.xml, so it looks like this:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
   <!DOCTYPE root [
       <!ENTITY railo SYSTEM "./web-railo.xml" >
   ]>

   c) Towards the bottom of web.xml, add the CFML-related file extensions
      to the <welcome-file-list> section:

	<welcome-file-list>
	    <welcome-file>index.cfm</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.htm</welcome-file>
	    <welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
	</welcome-file-list>

   d) Add "&railo;" at the bottom of the </web-app> section to include
      the "railo" xml entity defined above. This tells Tomcat to include
      the contents of the web-railo.xml file containing the Railo-related
      settings.

	&railo;
	</web-app>

Starting the service and online configuration
=============================================

- Start/restart tomcat:

	${RCDIR}/tomcat restart

- Connect to http://localhost:8080/. If all goes well you should see the
default Railo homepage including a couple of samples and links to the
admin pages.

- Connect to the admin pages and set passwords:

	http://localhost:8080/railo-context/admin/server.cfm
	http://localhost:8080/railo-context/admin/web.cfm

- You can add pages to /var/tomcat/webapps/ROOT to be used for "localhost".
Additional host configurations can be added to ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/server.xml.
Use the localhost configuration as a template; the _tomcat user will need to be
able to write to <appBase>/ROOT/WEB-INF, so set ownership and permissions
accordingly.

- Log files are kept in several locations. Consult them if things don't work
as expected, and don't forget to rotate/archive them as appropriate.

	${CATALINA_BASE}/logs
	${CATALINA_BASE}/railo/server-config/railo-server/context/logs
	${CATALINA_BASE}/railo/web-config/*/logs (various dirs, per-context)
