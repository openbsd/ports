Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data
(i.e. floating point numbers, integers and booleans, although it
can handle string data too). It has been designed to transmit data
to the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc main
goal is not just to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or
in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound computations.

C-Blosc2 is the new major version of C-Blosc, and is backward
compatible with both the C-Blosc1 API and its in-memory format.
However, the reverse thing is generally not true for the format;
buffers generated with C-Blosc2 are not format-compatible with
C-Blosc1 (i.e. forward compatibility is not supported). In case you
want to ensure full API compatibility with C-Blosc1 API, define the
BLOSC1_COMPAT symbol.
