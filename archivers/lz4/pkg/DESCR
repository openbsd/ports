LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features
an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems. The library is BSD-licensed.
