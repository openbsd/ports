heatshrink is a data compression/decompression library for
embedded/real-time systems.

Key Features:

- Low memory usage (as low as 50 bytes): It is useful for some cases
with less than 50 bytes, and useful for many general cases with
less than 300 bytes.

- Incremental, bounded CPU use: You can chew on input data in
arbitrarily tiny bites. This is a useful property in hard real-time
environments.

- Can use either static or dynamic memory allocation: The library
doesn't impose any constraints on memory management.

- ISC license: You can use it freely, even for commercial purposes.
