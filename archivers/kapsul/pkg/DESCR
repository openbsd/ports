Kapsul is a tool that allows you to run most plakar sub-commands directly on
.ptar archives. It transparently mounts the archive as an in-memory, read-only
Plakar repository, enabling inspection, restoration, and diffing operations
without extracting the archive.

Features:
Efficient access to .ptar archives
Supports most plakar commands
No persistent state or extraction required
