UCL is a portable lossless data compression library. It implements a
number of algorithms with the following features:

 - Decompression is simple and *very* fast.
 - Requires no memory for decompression.
 - The decompressors can be squeezed into less than 200 bytes of code.
 - Includes compression levels for generating pre-compressed
   data which achieve an excellent compression ratio.
 - Allows you to dial up extra compression at a speed cost in the
   compressor. The speed of the decompressor is not reduced.
 - Algorithm is thread safe.
 - Algorithm is lossless.

UCL supports in-place decompression.
