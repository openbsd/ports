This project provides Python bindings for interfacing with the Zstandard
compression library. A C extension and CFFI interface are provided.

The primary goal of the project is to provide a rich interface to the
underlying C API through a Pythonic interface while not sacrificing
performance. This means exposing most of the features and flexibility of
the C API while not sacrificing usability or safety that Python
provides.
