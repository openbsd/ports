Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several
different streaming archive formats, including most popular tar variants
and several cpio formats.

bsdtar is an almost fully GNU tar-compatible frontend for libarchive.
It is one of the fastest tar implementations and supports many advanced
features not found elsewhere.
