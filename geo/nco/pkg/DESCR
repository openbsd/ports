The netCDF Operators (NCO) comprise about a dozen standalone, command-line
programs that take netCDF, HDF, and/or DAP files as input, then operate
(e.g., derive new fields, compute statistics, print, hyperslab, manipulate
metadata, regrid) and output the results to screen or files in text, binary,
or netCDF formats. NCO aids analysis of gridded and unstructured scientific
data. The shell-command style of NCO allows users to manipulate and analyze
files interactively, or with expressive scripts that avoid some overhead of
higher-level programming environments.
