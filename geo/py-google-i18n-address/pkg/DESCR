This package contains a copy of Google's i18n address metadata
repository that contains great data but comes with no uptime guarantees.

Contents of this package will allow you to programatically build address
forms that adhere to rules of a particular region or country, validate
local addresses and format them to produce a valid address label for
delivery.

The package also contains a Python interface for address validation,
normalization, latinization and formatting.
