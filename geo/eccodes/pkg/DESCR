ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application
programming interface and a set of tools for decoding and encoding
messages in the following formats:

- WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1 and edition 2
- WMO FM-94 BUFR edition 3 and edition 4
- WMO GTS abbreviated header (only decoding)

A useful set of command line tools provide quick access to the messages.
C, Fortran 90 and Python interfaces provide access to the main ecCodes
functionality.

ecCodes is an evolution of GRIB API.  It is designed to provide the user
with a simple set of functions to access data from several formats with
a key/value approach.
