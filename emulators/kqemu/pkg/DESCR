The QEMU Accelerator (KQEMU) is a driver allowing a user application to
run x86 code in a Virtual Machine (VM). The code can be either user or
kernel code, in 64, 32 or 16 bit protected mode. KQEMU is very similar
in essence to the VM86 Linux syscall call, but it adds some new concepts
to improve memory handling.

KQEMU is ported on many host OSes (currently Linux, Windows, FreeBSD,
Solaris). It can execute code from many guest OSes (e.g. Linux, Windows
2000/XP) even if the host CPU does not support hardware virtualization.
