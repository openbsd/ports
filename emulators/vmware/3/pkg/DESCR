VMware is a proprietary/commercial x86 machine emulator.
Only a small part of the code base was made available, but it
was enough to get this port working on OpenBSD.
However, Version 3 is past its End Of Life with the supplier,
so you cannot buy licenses for it from vmware.com (dont even ask
them or the port maintainer).

You MUST either have a VMware V3 license already, or find one on
eBay or elsewhere, before you can use this product.

You should also consider the non-proprietary emulators such as
qemu and bochs (which are in ports) among others.
