If you built bochs with X support (default unless you specified the
no_x11 flavor) you must add the ${PREFIX}/share/bochs/fonts directory
to your X server's font path.
For XFree86, add the line:

FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/bochs/fonts"

in the "Files" section of your XF86Config file.  This is /etc/XF86Config
for XFree86 version 3, and /etc/X11/XF86Config for XFree86 version 4.
If you use a different X server, please see its documentation
on how to do this.

Then re-start your X server.

| Bochs requires a .bochsrc file to be present in either your current
| directory or your home directory before starting.  A sample of the
| .bochsrc file can be found in ${PREFIX}/share/bochs/bochsrc
