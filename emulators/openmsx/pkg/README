Using system ROMs
=================
If you want to emulate real MSX systems and not only the free C-BIOS
machines, put the system ROMs in one of the following directories:
${PREFIX}/share/openmsx/systemroms or ~/.openMSX/share/systemroms

Replays and savestates
======================
If you want openMSX to find MSX software referred to from replays or
savestates you get from your friends, copy that MSX software to
${PREFIX}/share/openmsx/software or ~/.openMSX/share/software
