Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was
expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in
2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added, and most
recently, a variable version.

It features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary
ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic
alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its
neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
