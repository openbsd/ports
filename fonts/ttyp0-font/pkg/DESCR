UW ttyp0 is a family of monospaced bitmap fonts. It covers most of
the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only
Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Tifinagh, Thai,
Braille, most of IPA (but no UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols,
some mathematics, line graphics, a few dingbats, and Powerline delimiter
symbols (about 3800 Unicode characters).

The UW ttyp0 fonts are available in bdf, pcf, and otb format for X11,
and as console fonts for Linux, FreeBSD (vt and syscons), NetBSD, and
OpenBSD. In addition to Unicode (ISO 10646-1), UW ttyp0 supports more
than 50 8-bit encodings (code pages).

UW ttyp0 comes in eleven sizes from 6x11 to 18x40. 28x60 and 36x80 can
be generated by naive scaling (meant only for high-resolution displays).
All sizes have regular and bold versions; some also an italic.

For many characters, several stylistic variants are provided (e.g.,
regular, dotted, or slashed zero, raised or centered tilde and asterisk,
Russian, Serbian, or Bulgarian Cyrillic characters), that can be
selected at build time.

Some of these variants are provided as flavors (most can be combined
if building from ports):

	sc		- use Serbian forms of Cyrillic italics
	sq		- straight accent and apostrophe
	sz/dz		- slashed zero/dotted zero
	ct		- centered ASCII tilde
	nbs/nbd		- display no-break space like normal space/with a dot
			  (this font displays it as a box by default)
