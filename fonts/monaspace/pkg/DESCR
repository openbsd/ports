The Monaspace type system is a monospaced type superfamily with some modern
tricks up its sleeve. It consists of five variable axis typefaces. Each one
has a distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another,
allowing you to mix and match them for a more expressive typographical
palette.

Monaspace features Texture Healing, a novel technique that evens out the
density of monospaced type, bringing it closer to how proportional type
has looked for centuries. Texture healing preserves the monospace grid,
and works in most editors without needing new software or editor plugins.

The Monaspace fonts come in four interchangeable variants:

- Monaspace ____: the static family
- Monaspace ____ Var or VF: the variable family
- Monaspace ____ NF: static families patched with NerdFonts
- Monaspace ____ Frozen: the "frozen" TTF family
