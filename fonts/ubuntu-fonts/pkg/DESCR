The Ubuntu Font Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts. The
development is being funded by Canonical on behalf the wider Free
Software community and the Ubuntu project. The technical font design
work and implementation is being undertaken by Dalton Maag.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used to
produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and you
are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve. The
typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType features and is manually hinted
for clarity on desktop and mobile computing screens.

The scope of the Ubuntu Font Family includes all the languages used by
the various Ubuntu users around the world in tune with Ubuntu's
philosophy which states that every user should be able to use their
software in the language of their choice. So the Ubuntu Font Family
project will be extended to cover many more written languages.
