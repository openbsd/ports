The EPSON MX-80 printer was a commercially successful product in the early
1980s. It was often used to print type in programs in computer magazines in
the 1980s. These fonts, transcribed from the "MX-80 EPSON DOT MATRIX PRINTER
TYPE II OPERATION MANUAL", are therefore useful for retro printout
simulation or program listings on web pages and in documentation.
