Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens.

Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and
lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like
contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of
surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from
"o", tabular numbers, etc.
