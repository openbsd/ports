American Fuzzy Lop is a brute-force fuzzer coupled with an exceedingly
simple but rock-solid instrumentation-guided genetic algorithm. It uses
an enhanced form of edge coverage to easily detect subtle, local-scale
changes to program control flow, without being bogged down by complex
comparisons between multiple long-winded execution paths.
