The Library of Assorted Spiffy Things (LibAST -  formerly libmej) was
originally designed as a  companion library to Eterm. However, it
contains  many features that other projects may find useful,  so it
has been broken out into its own library.  Features include thorough
debugging and memory tracking engines, various string manipulation
functions, and a flexible config file parsing engine.
