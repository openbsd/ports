Colors and emoji characters
===========================

A common question with recent GDB releases is how to disable the use of
colors and emoji.  To disable both, set

  set style enabled off

in your ~/.gdbinit or export NO_COLOR=1 in your environment (may also
affect other software).  See "Output Styling" in the info file for
more fine-grained settings.
