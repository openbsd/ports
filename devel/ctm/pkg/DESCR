CTM is a method for keeping a remote directory tree in sync with a
central one. It has been developed for usage with FreeBSD's source
trees, though other people may find it useful for other purposes as
time goes by.

This port uses the CTM kit developed by Giles Lean <giles@nemeton.com.au>
for NetBSD, using sources by Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>.

OpenBSD source and cvs directories are available through CTM for those
of us who are firewalled off from protocols such as cvsup or anoncvs.
