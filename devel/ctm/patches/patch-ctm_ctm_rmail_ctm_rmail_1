-.Nm ctm_smail ,
-.Nm ctm_dequeue
-and
+The
 .Nm ctm_rmail
-are used to distribute changes to a source tree via email.
-.Nm ctm_smail
-is given a compressed
-.Xr ctm
-delta, and a mailing list to send it to.  It splits the delta into manageable
-pieces, encodes them as mail messages and sends them to the mailing list
-(optionally queued to spread the mail load).
-Each recipient uses

 (either manually or automatically) to decode and reassemble the delta, and
 optionally call
 .Xr ctm
 to apply it to the source tree.
-At the moment,
-several source trees are distributed, and by several sites.  These include
-the FreeBSD-current source and CVS trees, distributed by
-.Li freefall.FreeBSD.org .

-.It Fl m Ar maxmsgsize
-Limit the maximum size mail message that
-.Nm ctm_smail
-is allowed to send.  It is approximate since mail headers and other niceties
-are not counted in this limit.  If not specified, it will default to 64000
-bytes, leaving room for 1535 bytes of headers before the rumoured 64k mail
-limit.
-.It Fl c Ar maxctmsize
-Limit the maximum size delta that will be sent.  Deltas bigger that this
-limit will cause an apology mail message to be sent to the mailing list.
-This is to prevent massive changes overwhelming users' mail boxes.  Note that
-this is the size before encoding.  Encoding causes a 4/3 size increase before
-mail headers are added.  If not specified, there is no limit.
-.It Fl q Ar queue-dir
-Instead of mailing the delta pieces now, store them in the given directory
-to be mailed later using
-.Nm ctm_dequeue .
-This feature allows the mailing of large deltas to be spread out over
-hours or even days to limit the impact on recipients with limited network
-bandwidth or small mail spool areas.
