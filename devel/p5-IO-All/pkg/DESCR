IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single nifty
object oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO
idioms. It exports a single function called "io", which returns a new
IO::All object. And that object can do it all!

The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket,
IO::String, Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards;
as well as all the DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the
methods found in these classes and in IO::Handle (which they inherit
from). IO::All adds dozens of other helpful idiomatic methods including
file stat and manipulation functions.

IO::All is pluggable, and modules like IO::All::LWP and IO::All::Mailto
add even more functionality. Optionally, every IO::All object can be
tied to itself. This means that you can use most perl IO builtins on it:
readline, <>, getc, print, printf, syswrite, sysread, close.
