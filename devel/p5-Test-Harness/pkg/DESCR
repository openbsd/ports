Although, for historical reasons, the Test::Harness distribution
takes its name from this module it now exists only to provide
TAP::Harness with an interface that is somewhat backwards compatible
with Test::Harness 2.xx. If you're writing new code consider using
TAP::Harness directly instead.

Emulation is provided for runtests and execute_tests but the pluggable
'Straps' interface that previous versions of Test::Harness supported
is not reproduced here. Straps is now available as a stand alone
module: Test::Harness::Straps.
