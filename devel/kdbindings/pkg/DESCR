Reactive programming & data binding in C++

From plain C++ you get:

 - Signals + Slots.
 - Properties templated on the contained type.
 - Property bindings allowing reactive code to be written without having to do
   all the low-level, error prone plumbing by hand.
 - Lazy evaluation of property bindings.
 - No more broken bindings.
 - Totally stand-alone header-only library. No heavy Qt dependency.
 - Can still be used with Qt if you so wish.
