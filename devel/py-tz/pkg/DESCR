pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.3 or
higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of
daylight savings, which you can read more about in the Python Library
Reference (datetime.tzinfo).
