simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected
operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. It
understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight branches, integrated
code review and 3rd party testing. It uses cryptographic version naming
and client-side RSA certificates. It has good internationalization
support, has no external dependencies.
