git-bz is a tool for integrating the Git command line with the Bugzilla
bug-tracking system. Operations such as attaching patches to bugs,
applying patches in bugs to your current tree, and closing bugs once
you've pushed the fixes publicly can be done completely from the command
line without having to go to your web browser.
