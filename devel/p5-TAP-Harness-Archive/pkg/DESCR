This module is a direct subclass of TAP::Harness and behaves in
exactly the same way except for one detail. In addition to outputting
a running progress of the tests and an ending summary it can also
capture all of the raw TAP from the individual test files or streams
into an archive file (".tar" or ".tar.gz").
