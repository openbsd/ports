Click is a package for creating powerful and beautiful command line
interfaces (CLI) in Python, but it has no the functionality for
creating option groups.

Option groups are convenient mechanism for logical structuring CLI,
also it allows you to set the specific behavior and set the
relationship among grouped options (mutually exclusive options for
example).
