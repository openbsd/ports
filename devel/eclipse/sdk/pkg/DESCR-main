The Eclipse Platform is an IDE for anything, and for nothing in
particular. It has a lot of built-in generic functionality, but it
requires plug-ins to extend the Platform's features and to work with
new content types. Eclipse comes with a base set of plug-ins called
Java development tooling (JDT) and Plug-in development environment
(PDE). JDT adds the capabilities of a full-featured Java IDE to the
Eclipse Platform. PDE adds a number of views and editors that make it
easier to build plug-ins for Eclipse. The Eclipse Platform together
with JDT and PDE form the Eclipse SDK, a complete development
environment for Eclipse-based tools, and for developing Eclipse itself.
