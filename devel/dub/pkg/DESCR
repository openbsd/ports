Dub is the package and build manager for D applications and libraries.

There is a central package registry located at https://code.dlang.org
where packages can be installed and managed using dub.

The project's philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible. All
that is needed to make a project a dub package is to write a short
dub.json file and put the source code into a source subfolder. It can
then be registered on the public package registry to be made available
for everyone. Any dependencies specified in dub.json are automatically
downloaded and made available to the project during the build process.
