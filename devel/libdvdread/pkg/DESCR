libdvdread provides a simple foundation for reading DVD-Video images.
It offers DVD applications:

1. A simple abstraction for reading the files on a DVD image
   (dvd_reader.h).
2. A simple library for parsing the information (IFO) files
   (ifo_read.h/ifo_types.h).
3. A simple library for parsing the navigation (NAV) packets
   (nav_read.h/nav_types.h).

This allows application designers to access some of the more advanced
features of the DVD format.

libdvdread currently uses dlopen() to dynamically probe for libdvdcss at
runtime.  If libdvdcss is found, then it will be used to decrypt the
encrypted sections of a DVD.
