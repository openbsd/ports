samurai is a ninja-compatible build tool written in C99 with a focus on
simplicity, speed, and portability.

samurai implements the ninja build language through version 1.9.0. It
uses the same format for .ninja_log and .ninja_deps as ninja, currently
version 5 and 4 respectively.

It is feature-complete and supports most of the same options as ninja.
