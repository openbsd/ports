git-cinnabar is a git remote helper to interact with mercurial
repositories. Contrary to other such helpers, it doesn't use a local
mercurial clone under the hood.

The main focus at the moment is to make it work with mozilla-central
and related mercurial repositories and support Mozilla workflows (try
server, etc.).
