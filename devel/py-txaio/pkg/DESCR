txaio is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on both
Twisted and asyncio / Trollius.

This is like six, but for wrapping over differences between Twisted and
asyncio so one can write code that runs unmodified on both (aka source
code compatibility). In other words: your users can choose if they want
asyncio or Twisted as a dependency.

Note that, with this approach, user code runs under the native event
loop of either Twisted or asyncio. This is different from attaching
either one's event loop to the other using some event loop adapter.
