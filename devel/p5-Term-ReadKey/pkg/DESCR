This module, ReadKey, provides ioctl control for terminals and Win32
consoles so the input modes can be changed (thus allowing reads of a single
character at a time), and also provides non-blocking reads of stdin, as well
as several other terminal related features, including retrieval/modification
of the screen size, and retrieval/modification of the control characters.
