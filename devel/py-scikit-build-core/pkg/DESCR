Scikit-build-core is a build backend for Python that uses CMake to build
extension modules. It has a simple yet powerful static configuration system
in pyproject.toml, and supports almost unlimited flexibility via CMake. It
was initially developed to support the demanding needs of scientific users,
but can build any sort of package that uses CMake.
