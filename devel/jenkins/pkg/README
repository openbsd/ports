SECURITY NOTES
==============

Jenkins runs external processes such as CVS, Ant, Make and so on, whose
path is configurable from the web menu system.

Please make very sure to enable login restriction under Manage Jenkins
-> Configure Global Security if your server is reachable from any
(untrusted) network! If you only run it on localhost, be sure to block
access to the HTTP port using pf(8).

Take these steps before you start the server the first time!

See more information at
http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Securing+Jenkins

Post-installation
=================

To arrange for the standalone Jenkins server to run automatically
on reboot, add "jenkins" to your pkg_scripts" line in /etc/rc.conf.local.

NOTE: This script runs Jenkins on port 8000, not 8080, since most
Java application servers run on port 8080. By default we disable
HTTPS and AJP, since the former is extra overhead on localhost and
the latter conflicts with most Java application servers' AJP port.

To change any of these options, carefully copy the line
starting daemon_flags= from ${RCDIR}/jenkins into /etc/rc.conf.local
and change the daemon_flags to jenkins_flags in addition to any
changes to the ports and other options.

To run Jenkins in another Java web/application server, copy the war
file from ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/jenkins to your server's deploy
directory, or read more at ${HOMEPAGE}. 

To use the email notifications, you will have to configure a valid
sending address (and SMTP server, if not localhost) under
Manage Jenkins -> Email Configuration.

The Jenkins data files are in the home directory (/var/jenkins),
under the "hidden" directory ".jenkins".

If you are upgrading from Hudson to Jenkins, you can copy the old
content of /var/hudson/.hudson into /var/jenkins/.jenkins, e.g.,
	# cp -r /var/hudson/.hudson/* /var/jenkins/.jenkins
	# chown -R _jenkins:_jenkins /var/jenkins/.jenkins

Please be aware that Jenkins offers an upgrade for the CVS plugin. It is
strongly advised *not* to upgrade this plugin as the updated version assumes
a GNU rlog command line option (-S) is available.
