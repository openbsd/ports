$OpenBSD: patch-boost_config_compiler_gcc_hpp,v 1.1 2016/06/01 14:56:54 dcoppa Exp $

boost does not like mixing different compilers at build and compile
time.

We build boost itself with gcc-4.2.1 from base, which doesn't support
the integer scalar type __int128, and this results in a
/usr/local/include/boost/config/user.hpp lacking the "BOOST_HAS_INT128"
define.

When compiling something that depends on boost using a newer compiler
like gcc-4.9 or clang, a code snippet in
/usr/local/include/boost/config/compiler/{clang,gcc}.hpp reactivates
__int128 support, but the code containing typedef declarations
inside /usr/local/include/boost/config/suffix.hpp is never reached,
because /usr/local/include/boost/config/user.hpp lacks "BOOST_HAS_INT128".
Hence, the following errors occur:

/usr/local/include/boost/type_traits/is_integral.hpp:72:1: error: 'int128_type' is not a member of 'boost'
/usr/local/include/boost/type_traits/is_integral.hpp:73:1: error: 'uint128_type' is not a member of 'boost'

As a temporary band-aid, completely disable __int128 support on
OpenBSD.
