This module provides a framework for generating UUIDs (Universally
Unique Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). A
UUID is 128 bits long, and is guaranteed to be different from all other
UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 A.D. UUIDs were originally used in the
Network Computing System (NCS) and later in the Open Software
Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment. Currently many
different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity for
various software components, Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and
components across network-connected systems.
