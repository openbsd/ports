$OpenBSD: patch-lib_Target_X86_X86RegisterInfo_td,v 1.6 2019/07/06 15:06:36 jca Exp $

- The compiler is generally free to allocate general purpose registers in
  whatever order it chooses. Reasons for choosing one register before another
  usually include compiled instruction size (avoidance of REX prefixes, etc.)
  or usage conventions, but somehow haven't included security implications in
  the compiled bytecode. Some bytecode is more useful in polymorphic ROP
  sequences than others, so it seems prudent to try to avoid that bytecode
  when possible.

  This patch moves EBX/RBX towards the end of the allocation preference for 32
  and 64 bit general purpose registers. Some instructions using RBX/EBX/BX/BL
  as a destination register end up with a ModR/M byte of C3 or CB, which is often
  useful in ROP gadgets. Because these gadgets often occur in the middle of
  functions, they exhibit somewhat higher diversity than some other C3/CB
  terminated gadgets. This change removes about 3% of total gadgets from the
  kernel, but about 6% of unique gadgets.

  There are other possible changes in this direction. BX/BL are obvious next
  targets for avoidance, and MM3/XMM3 may also be useful to try to avoid if
  possible.
