Robot Framework is a generic open source test automation framework for
acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has
easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven
testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended by test
libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create
new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that
is used for creating test cases.
