Jsonrpc-GLib is a library to communicate with JSON-RPC based peers in either a
synchronous or asynchronous fashion.
It also allows communicating using the GVariant serialization format instead of
JSON when both peers support it.
You might want that when communicating on a single host to avoid parser overhead
and memory-allocator fragmentation.
