A little fail-safe filesystem designed for microcontrollers.

This tool is specifically patched to work with Espressif ESP8266 line of chips.

Power-loss resilience - littlefs is designed to handle random power failures.
All file operations have strong copy-on-write guarantees and if power is lost
the filesystem will fall back to the last known good state.

Dynamic wear leveling - littlefs is designed with flash in mind, and provides
wear leveling over dynamic blocks. Additionally, littlefs can detect bad blocks
and work around them.

Bounded RAM/ROM - littlefs is designed to work with a small amount of memory.
RAM usage is strictly bounded, which means RAM consumption does not change as
the filesystem grows. The filesystem contains no unbounded recursion and dynamic
memory is limited to configurable buffers that can be provided statically.
