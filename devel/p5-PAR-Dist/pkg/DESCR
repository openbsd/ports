This module creates and manipulates PAR distributions. They are
architecture-specific PAR files, containing everything under blib/ of
CPAN distributions after their make or Build stage, a META.yml
describing metadata of the original CPAN distribution, and a MANIFEST
detailing all files within it. Digitally signed PAR distributions will
also contain a SIGNATURE file.
