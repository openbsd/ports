Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine
the benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing.

Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check
them. Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch
many programming errors by analyzing your program, without actually
having to run it. Mypy has a powerful type system with features such as
type inference, gradual typing, generics and union types.
