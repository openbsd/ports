This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject libraries.
GLib is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a generic
type system with inheritance and a powerful signal system. Together
these libraries are used as the foundation for many of the libraries
that make up the Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated
projects.
