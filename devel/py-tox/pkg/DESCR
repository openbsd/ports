tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line
tool you can use for:

* checking your package builds and installs correctly under different
environments (such as different Python implementations, versions or
installation dependencies),

* running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of
choice,

* acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly
reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
