Dunamai is a Python 3.5+ library and command line tool for producing
dynamic, standards-compliant version strings, derived from tags in your
version control system. This facilitates uniquely identifying nightly or
per-commit builds in continuous integration and releasing new versions
of your software simply by creating a tag.
