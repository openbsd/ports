Vulture finds unused code in Python programs. This is useful for
cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run
Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested
code. Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like
Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only
called implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, Vulture
can be a very helpful tool for higher code quality.
