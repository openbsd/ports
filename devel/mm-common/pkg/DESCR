The mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities
shared among the GNOME C++ binding libraries.  It is only a required
dependency for building the C++ bindings from the gnome.org version
control repository.  An installation of mm-common is not required for
building tarball releases, unless configured to use maintainer-mode.
