Ucpp is a C preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light,
but fully compliant with the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known
as C99. Ucpp can be compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to
some other code; in the latter case, ucpp will output tokens, one
at a time, on demand, as an integrated lexer.
