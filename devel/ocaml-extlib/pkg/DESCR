ExtLib is a project aiming at providing a complete - yet small -
standard library for the OCaml programming langage. The purpose of this
library is to add new functions to OCaml Standard Library modules, to
modify some functions in order to get better performances or more safety
(tail-recursive) but also to provide new modules which should be useful
for the average OCaml programmer.
