The dyncall library encapsulates architecture-, OS- and compiler-specific
function call semantics in a virtual bind argument parameters from
left to right and then call interface allowing programmers to call
C functions in a completely dynamic manner. In other words, instead
of calling a function directly, the dyncall library provides a
mechanism to push the function parameters manually and to issue the
call afterwards.  This means, that a program can determine at runtime
what function to call, and what parameters to pass to it. The library
is written in C and assembly and provides a very simple C interface
to program against.
