Assertions are the explicit expressions of your assumptions about the
reality your program is expected to deal with, and a declaration of
those which it is not. They are used to prevent your program from
blissfully processing garbage inputs (garbage in, garbage out becomes
garbage in, error out) and to tell you when you've produced garbage
output.
