Additional Dependencies
=======================

If you need to assemble x86/amd64 asm then you should install nasm
(devel/nasm), although this is not essential to the use of radare2.

NOTE: nasm is not available for all architectures on OpenBSD.

Bindings
========

For now, we have only enabled the Vala bindings (as the radare2-bindings
package). Further languages may be enabled in the future.
