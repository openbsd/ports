This module provides a simple object for logging to files under the
Log::Dispatch::* system, and automatically rotating them according
to different constraints. This is basically a Log::Dispatch::File
wrapper with additions. To that end the arguments:
        name, min_level, filename and mode
behave the same as Log::Dispatch::File. So see its man page (perldoc
Log::Dispatch::File)
