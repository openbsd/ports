AVRDUDE is a full featured BSD Unix program for programming Atmel's AVR
CPU's. It can program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the
serial programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE
also supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any
programming instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE
implements that specific feature of a particular chip. 

If you're planning on programming *duino devices with avrdude, you'll want
to invoke it something like this:

    avrdude -b19200 -P /dev/cuaU0 -c arduino -p atmega168 -U flash:w:blink.hex
