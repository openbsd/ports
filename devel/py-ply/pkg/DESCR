PLY is an implementation of the lex and yacc parsing tools written
entirely in Python. It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and
well suited for larger grammars.

PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support
for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for
ambiguous grammars.

It's been abandoned upstream and not expected to be maintained any more.

Note: do *not* use the undocumented 'picklefile' parameter with untrusted
or externally writable files - Python's pickle module permits execution
of embedded code during deserialization, so a malicious pickle file can
execute arbitrary code during parser setup.
