Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis on
internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
needed; however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and font
handling for GTK+-2.0.
