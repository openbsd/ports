Shell::Guess makes a reasonably aggressive attempt to determine the shell being
employed by the user, either the shell that executed the perl script directly
(the "running" shell), or the users' login shell (the "login" shell). It does
this by a variety of means available to it, depending on the platform that it
is running on.
