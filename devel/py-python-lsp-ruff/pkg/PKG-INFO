`python-lsp-ruff` is a plugin for `python-lsp-server` that adds **linting**, **code actions** and **formatting** capabilities that are provided by [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff),
an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust.

Note that `ruff>0.4.5` ships with a built-in LSP server (and `ruff-lsp` before that), which allows linting, formatting and code actions.
In contrast, this implementation adds `ruff` as a plugin for `pylsp` in addition to `pylsp`'s other functionalities (go-to support, ...).

## Install

In the same `virtualenv` as `python-lsp-server`:

```shell
pip install python-lsp-ruff
```

There also exists an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-lsp-ruff).

### When using ruff before version 0.1.0
Ruff version `0.1.0` introduced API changes that are fixed in Python LSP Ruff `v1.6.0`. To continue with `ruff<0.1.0` please use `v1.5.3`, e.g. using `pip`:

```sh
pip install "ruff<0.1.0" "python-lsp-ruff==1.5.3"
```

## Usage

This plugin will disable `pycodestyle`, `pyflakes`, `mccabe`, `autopep8`, and `yapf` by default, unless they are explicitly enabled in the client configuration.
When `python-lsp-ruff` is enabled, all linting diagnostics and formatting capabilities will be provided by `ruff`.

Any codes given in the `format` option will only be marked as `fixable` for ruff during the formatting operation, the user has to make sure that these codes are also in the list of codes that ruff checks!


## Configuration

Configuration options can be passed to the python-language-server. If a `pyproject.toml`
file is present in the project, `python-lsp-ruff` will ignore specific options (see below).

The plugin follows [python-lsp-server's configuration](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/#configuration).
This example configuration using for `neovim` shows the possible options:

      unfixable = { "F401" }, -- Rules that are excluded when checking the code actions (including the "Fix All" action)

      -- Rules that are ignored when a pyproject.toml or ruff.toml is present:
      lineLength = 88,  -- Line length to pass to ruff checking and formatting
      exclude = { "__about__.py" },  -- Files to be excluded by ruff checking
      select = { "F" },  -- Rules to be enabled by ruff
      ignore = { "D210" },  -- Rules to be ignored by ruff
      perFileIgnores = { ["__init__.py"] = "CPY001" },  -- Rules that should be ignored for specific files
      preview = false,  -- Whether to enable the preview style linting and formatting.
      targetVersion = "py310",  -- The minimum python version to target (applies for both linting and formatting).

For more information on the configuration visit [Ruff's homepage](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/).

### Custom severities

By default, all diagnostics are marked as warning, except for `"E999"` and all error codes starting with `"F"`, which are displayed as errors.
This default can be changed through the `pylsp.plugins.ruff.severities` option, which takes the error code as a key and any of
`"E"`, `"W"`, `"I"` and `"H"` to be displayed as errors, warnings, information and hints, respectively.
For more information on the diagnostic severities please refer to
[the official LSP reference](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#diagnosticSeverity).

With `v2.0.0` it is also possible to use patterns to match codes. Rules match if the error code starts with the given pattern. If multiple patterns match the error code, `python-lsp-ruff` chooses the one with the most amount of matching characters.


## Code formatting

With `python-lsp-ruff>1.6.0` formatting is done using [ruffs own formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) by default.
Formatting using ruff can be explicitly disabled by setting `formatEnabled = false` in the LSP settings.
Additional rules that should be fixed during the `textDocument/formatting` request can be added with the `format` option.

Coming from previous versions the only change is that `isort` rules are **not** applied by default.
To enable sorting of imports using ruff's isort functionality, add `"I"` to the list of `format` rules. 


## Code actions

`python-lsp-ruff` supports code actions as given by possible fixes by `ruff`. `python-lsp-ruff` also supports [unsafe fixes](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#fix-safety).
Fixes considered unsafe by `ruff` are marked `(unsafe)` in the code action.
The `Fix all` code action *only* consideres safe fixes.

## Debugging

The log level can be set via the `cmd` option of `pylsp`:

```lua
vim.lsp.config("pylsp",  {
  cmd = {"pylsp", "-vvv", "--log-file", "/tmp/lsp.log"},
  settings = {
    pylsp = {
      plugins = {
        ruff = {
          enabled = true,
        },
      }
    }
  }
})
```
