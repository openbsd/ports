Data::FormValidator's main aim is to make input validation expressible
in a simple format.

Data::FormValidator lets you define profiles which declare the
required and optional fields and any constraints they might have.

The results are provided as an object which makes it easy to handle
missing and invalid results, return error messages about which
constraints failed, or process the resulting valid data.
