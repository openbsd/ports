This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build
the Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include a modified c2hs
binding tool that is used to generate FFI declarations, a tool to
build a type hierarchy that mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects
found in glib, and a generator for signal declarations that are
used to call back from C to Haskell. These tools are not needed to
actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
