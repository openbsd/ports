This module is intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT, supporting
the same interface, but using Class::C3 to do the hard work.  You can
then write new code without NEXT, and migrate individual source files to
use Class::C3 or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace
you're comfortable with.
