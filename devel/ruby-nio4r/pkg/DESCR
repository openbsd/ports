New I/O for Ruby (nio4r): cross-platform asynchronous I/O primitives for
scalable network clients and servers. Modeled after the Java NIO API,
but simplified for ease-of-use.

nio4r provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O selector API for
Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of "reactor"-based event loops, and
monitor multiple I/O objects for various types of readiness, e.g. ready
for reading or writing.
