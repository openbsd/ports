pytest plugin to make output slightly easier to read and errors easy to
find and fix.

- Realtime error summary: One-line info on which test has failed while
tests are running.

- Table of failures with both test line number and error line number,
easier to see where errors occur than scrolling through backtraces.

- Prettier summary of a test run, including time taken.
