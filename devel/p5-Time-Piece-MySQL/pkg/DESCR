Using this module in addition to "Time::Piece" adds a
few MySQL-specific date-time methods to "Time::Piece" objects.

OBJECT METHODS
  mysql_date / mysql_time / mysql_datetime / mysql_timestamp
    Returns the date and/or time in a format suitable for use by MySQL.

CONSTRUCTORS
  from_mysql_date / from_mysql_datetime / from_mysql_timestamp
    Given a date, datetime, or timestamp value as returned from MySQL, these
    constructors return a new Time::Piece object. If the value is NULL, they
    will retrun undef.
