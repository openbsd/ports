The zope.event package provides a simple event system, including:

- An event publishing API, intended for use by applications which are
unaware of any subscribers to their events.

- A very simple event-dispatching system on which more sophisticated
event dispatching systems can be built. For example, a type-based
event dispatching system that builds on zope.event can be found in
zope.component.

Please see http://zopeevent.rtfd.org/ for the documentation.
