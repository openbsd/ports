Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while
integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), Black, isort,
pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake, and more, all while executing tens or
hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.
