remake is a patched and modernized version of GNU make utility that
adds improved error reporting, the ability to trace execution in a
comprehensible way, and a debugger. Some of the features of the
debugger are:

    * see the target call stack.
    * set breakpoints on targets,
    * show and set variables,
    * execute arbitrary "make" code
    * issue shell commands while stopped in the middle of execution,
    * inspect target descriptions
    * write a file with the commands of the target expanded.
