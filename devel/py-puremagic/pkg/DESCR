Puremagic is a pure python module that will identify a file based off it's magic
numbers. It is designed to be minimalistic and inherently cross platform
compatible. It is also designed to be a stand in for python-magic.

It does NOT try to match files off non-magic string. In other words it will not
search for a string within a certain window of bytes like others might.
