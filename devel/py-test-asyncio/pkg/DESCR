pytest-asyncio is an Apache2 licensed library, written in Python,
for testing asyncio code with pytest.

asyncio code is usually written in the form of coroutines, which
makes it slightly more difficult to test using normal testing tools.
pytest-asyncio provides useful fixtures and markers to make testing
easier.
