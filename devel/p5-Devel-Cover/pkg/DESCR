This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl.  Code coverage
metrics describe how thoroughly tests exercise code.  By using
Devel::Cover you can discover areas of code not exercised by your tests
and determine which tests to create to increase coverage.  Code coverage
can be considered as an indirect measure of quality.
