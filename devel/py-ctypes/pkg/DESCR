ctypes is an advanced ffi (Foreign Function Interface) package for
Python 2.3 and higher.

ctypes allows to call functions exposed from dlls/shared libraries and
has extensive facilities to create, access and manipulate simple and
complicated C data types in Python - in other words: wrap libraries in
pure Python. It is even possible to implement C callback functions in
pure Python.
