XULRunner is a single "gecko runtime" installable package that can
be used to bootstrap multiple XUL+XPCOM applications that are as
rich as Firefox and Thunderbird.  It will provide mechanisms for
installing, upgrading, and uninstalling these applications. XULRunner
will also provide libxul, a solution which allows the embedding of
Mozilla technologies in other projects and products.
