Xdebug is an extension for PHP, and provides a range of features to
improve the PHP development experience.

Step Debugging:
    A way to step through your code in your IDE or editor while
    the script is executing.

Improvements to PHP's error reporting:
    An improved var_dump() function, stack traces for Notices, Warnings,
    Errors and Exceptions to highlight the code path to the error.

Tracing:
    Writes every function call, with arguments and invocation location
    to disk. Optionally also includes every variable assignment and
    return value for each function.

Profiling:
    Allows you, with the help of visualisation tools, to analyse the
    performance of your PHP application and find bottlenecks.

Code Coverage Analysis:
    To show which parts of your code base are executed when running
    unit tests with PHP Unit.
