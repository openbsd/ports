Normally, a test function will fail and stop running with the first
failed assert. That's totally fine for tons of kinds of software
tests. However, there are times where you'd like to check more than
one thing, and you'd really like to know the results of each check,
even if one of them fails. pytest-check allows multiple failed
"checks" per test function, so you can see the whole picture of
what's going wrong.
