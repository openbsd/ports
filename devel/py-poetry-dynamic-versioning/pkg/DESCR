This is a plugin for Poetry to enable dynamic versioning based on tags
in your version control system, powered by Dunamai. Many different
version control systems are supported, including Git and Mercurial;
please refer to Dunamai for the full list.

Once the plugin is set up, you can create tags in your version control
system (e.g., git tag v0.1.0 -m "New release"), and the plugin
will automatically insert that version into relevant files (like
pyproject.toml or *.py files with a __version__ line) for the duration
of Poetry commands such as poetry build, then revert the changes
afterwards to keep your repository clean. The plugin aims to inject a
static copy of the version into build artifacts (sdists/wheels) without
the need to manually edit and commit changed files in your repository.
