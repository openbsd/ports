This module provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST matches
the distribution.

It tests three things:
- Everything in MANIFEST exists
- Everything in the package is listed in MANIFEST,
  or subsequently matches a regular expression mask in MANIFEST.SKIP
- Nothing exists in MANIFEST that also matches a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP,
  so as to avoid an unsatisfiable dependency conditions If there is no
  MANIFEST.SKIP included in your distribution, this module will
  replicate the toolchain behaviour of using the default system-wide
  MANIFEST.SKIP file.
