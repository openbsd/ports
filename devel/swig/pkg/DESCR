SWIG is a tool for automatically generating the wrapper code needed
to link collections of functions written in C/C++ with interpreted
scripting languages.    Currently, SWIG supports :

	- Guile
	- Java
	- Mzscheme
	- PHP
	- Perl
	- Python
	- Ruby
	- Tcl

Using SWIG, it is possible to greatly simplify interface development
and to put interesting interfaces on existing applications with
little effort.
