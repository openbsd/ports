SPLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal
effort, SPLint can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is
invested adding annotations to programs, SPLint can perform stronger
checks than can be done by any standard lint.

SPLint can detect lots of obscure errors that other lints can't find.
It takes some getting used to, and tends to output quite a large number
of warnings unless tuned for the current project.

It is the successor of LCLint, an earlier effort, with more checks 
with respect to buffer sizes calculations.
