Sfio manages I/O streams, much like the ANSI C Standard I/O library,
via a distinct interface that is more powerful, robust and efficient.

o Separate thread-safe I/O library.
o Correct sharing of file descriptors across streams and/or processes.
o An adaptive buffering algorithm enhances overall I/O performance.
o Efficient and customizable data formatting functions.
o I/O disciplines can be used to pre/post-process R/W data from/to streams.
o Streams can be stacked for recursive processing of nested streams.
o Streams can be pooled for automatic stream synchronization as I/O
  operations are switched from stream to stream.
o Support for zero-copy stream I/O.
o Support for reading lines and records of any length from any stream.
