SMPEG is a free MPEG-1 video player library with sound support.  Video
playback is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley MPEG player, mpeg_play v2.2.
SMPEG support MPEG audio (MP3), based on mpg123's source, MPEG-1 video,
and MPEG system streams.

plaympeg2 is a simple video player provided to test the library.

This is a work in progress. Only 16 bit colour depth is supported.  The
player will dynamically convert to other colour depths, but playback will
be much faster if your display is already set to 16 bit colour depth.
