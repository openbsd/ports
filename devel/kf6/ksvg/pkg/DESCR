KSvg provides both C++ classes and QtQuick components to render svgs based on
image packs. Compared to plain QSvg, it caches the rendered images on disk with
KImageCache, and can re-color properly crafted svg shapes that include internal
stylesheets.

The default behavior is to re-color with the application palette, making it
possible to create UI elements in SVG.
