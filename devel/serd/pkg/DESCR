Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and
writing Turtle, TRiG, NTriples, and NQuads.

Serd is suitable for performance-critical or resource-limited applications,
such as serialising very large data sets, network protocols, or embedded
systems that require minimal dependencies and lightweight deployment.
