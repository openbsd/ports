mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class. It removes
the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After
performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods
or attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You
can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the
normal way.

The mock module also provides utility functions / objects to assist
with testing, particularly monkey patching.

This module backports mock to Python 2.7 and earlier versions of
Python 3.x
