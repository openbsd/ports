Mox will make mock objects for you, so you don't have to create your
own! It mocks the public/protected interfaces of Python objects. You set
up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific language
(DSL), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor!

This package provides Mox3, an unofficial update with Python 3 support.
It is fairly compatible with mox, but small enhancements have been made.
