dnSpy is a debugger and .NET assembly editor. You can use it to edit and debug
assemblies even if you don't have any source code available. Main features:

Debugger
* Debug .NET Framework, .NET Core and Unity game assemblies, no source code
  required
* Set breakpoints and step into any assembly
* Locals, watch, autos windows
* Variables windows support saving variables (eg. decrypted byte arrays) to
  disk or view them in the hex editor (memory window)
* Object IDs
* Multiple processes can be debugged at the same time
* Break on module load
* Tracepoints and conditional breakpoints
* Export/import breakpoints and tracepoints
* Call stack, threads, modules, processes windows
* Break on thrown exceptions (1st chance)
* Variables windows support evaluating C# / Visual Basic expressions
* Dynamic modules can be debugged (but not dynamic methods due to CLR
  limitations)
* Output window logs various debugging events, and it shows timestamps by
  default :)
* Assemblies that decrypt themselves at runtime can be debugged, dnSpy will use
  the in-memory image. You can also force dnSpy to always use in-memory images
  instead of disk files.
* Public API, you can write an extension or use the C# Interactive window to
  control the debugger

Assembly Editor
* All metadata can be edited
* Edit methods and classes in C# or Visual Basic with IntelliSense, no source
  code required
* Add new methods, classes or members in C# or Visual Basic
* IL editor for low-level IL method body editing
* Low-level metadata tables can be edited. This uses the hex editor internally.

Hex Editor
* Click on an address in the decompiled code to go to its IL code in the hex
  editor
* The reverse of the above, press F12 in an IL body in the hex editor to go to
  the decompiled code or other high-level representation of the bits. It's great
  to find out which statement a patch modified.
* Highlights .NET metadata structures and PE structures
* Tooltips show more info about the selected .NET metadata / PE field
* Go to position, file, RVA Go to .NET metadata token, method body, #Blob /
  #Strings / #US heap offset or #GUID heap index
* Follow references (Ctrl+F12)

Other
* BAML decompiler
* Blue, light and dark themes (and a dark high contrast theme)
* Bookmarks
* C# Interactive window can be used to script dnSpy
* Search assemblies for classes, methods, strings, etc
* Analyze class and method usage, find callers, etc
* Multiple tabs and tab groups
* References are highlighted, use Tab / Shift+Tab to move to the next reference
* Go to the entry point and module initializer commands
* Go to metadata token or metadata row commands
* Code tooltips (C# and Visual Basic)
* Export to project
