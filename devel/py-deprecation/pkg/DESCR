deprecation is a library that enables automated deprecations. It offers the
deprecated() decorator to wrap functions, providing proper warnings both in
documentation and via Python's warnings system, as well as the
deprecation.fail_if_not_removed() decorator for test methods to ensure that
deprecated code is eventually removed.
