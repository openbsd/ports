This is the Proc::Background package.  It provides a generic interface
to running background processes.  Through this interface, users can
run background processes on different operating systems without
concerning themselves about the specifics of doing this.  Users of
this package create new Proc::Background objects that provide an
object oriented interface to process management.  The following
methods are provided to users of the Proc::Background package:

    new:        start a new background process.
    alive:      test to see if the process is still alive.
    die:        reliably try to kill the process.
    wait:       wait for the process to exit and return the exit status.
    start_time: return the time that the process started.
    end_time:   return the time when the exit status was retrieved.
