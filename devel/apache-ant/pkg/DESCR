Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to
drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points
dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of
Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to
compile, assemble, test and run Java applications.
