Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code
analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of
Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding
guidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conway's book Perl
Best Practices. However, Perl::Critic is not limited to PBP and will
even support Policies that contradict Conway. You can enable, disable,
and customize those Polices through the Perl::Critic interface. You can
also create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes.
