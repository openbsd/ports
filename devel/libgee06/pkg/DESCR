libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
classes for commonly used data structures.

libgee provides the following interfaces:

        * Iterable
          * Collection
            * List
            * Set
        * Iterator
        * Map

The ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap classes provide a reasonable sample
implementation of the List, Set, and Map interfaces. ReadOnlyCollection,
ReadOnlyList, ReadOnlySet, and ReadOnlyMap are read-only wrapper classes
that prevent modification of the underlying collection.

libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C
library. It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
