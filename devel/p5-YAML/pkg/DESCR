The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper based on the
YAML 1.0 specification. http://www.yaml.org/spec/

YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for
human readability. It can be used to express the data structures
of most modern programming languages. (Including Perl!!!)
