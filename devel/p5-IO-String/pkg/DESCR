The module provide the IO::File interface for in-core strings.  An
object can be attached to a string, and will make it possible to use
the normal file operations for reading or writing data, as well as
seeking to various locations of the string. The main reason you might
want to do this, is if you have some other library module that only
provide an interface to file handles, and you want to keep all the
stuff in memory.
