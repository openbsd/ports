Kirill Simonov's libyaml is arguably the best YAML implementation.
The C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification.
It was originally bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl the
best YAML support to date.

This module exports the functions Dump, Load, DumpFile and LoadFile.
These functions are intended to work exactly like YAML.pm's
corresponding functions. Only Load and Dump are exported by default.
