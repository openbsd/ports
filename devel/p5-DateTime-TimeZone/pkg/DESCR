The DateTime::TimeZone modules provide a Perl interface to the Olson
time zone database.  Rather than using the database directly, we parse
the database files and turn them into a set of modules, one for each
time zone defined.  This allows for various optimizations in doing
time zone calculations.  

Warning: p5-Datetime-TimeZone and p5-DateTime are actually dependent on 
one another at runtime.
