This module checks whether a particular dynamic library is available
for FFI to use.  It is modeled heavily on Devel::CheckLib, but will
find dynamic libraries even when development packages are not
installed.  It also provides a find_lib function that will return
the full path to the found dynamic library, which can be feed
directly into FFI::Platypus or another FFI system.
