The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
in.  Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library
includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered
command lines to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform
csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

The history facilities are also placed into a separate library, the
History library, as part of the build process.  The History library may
be used without Readline in applications which desire its capabilities.

To avoid any confusion with the base readline/history library make sure
you link to ereadline and ehistory.  In the headers you can check for
RL_READLINE_VERSION, RL_VERSION_MAJOR and RL_VERSION_MINOR to see which
header you have picked up.
