The accessors pragma lets you create simple accessors at compile-time.

This saves you from writing them by hand, which tends to result in
cut-n-paste errors and a mess of duplicated code. It can also help you
reduce the ammount of unwanted direct-variable access that may creep
into your codebase when you're feeling lazy. accessors was designed with
laziness in mind.
