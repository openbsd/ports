inline-snapshot is a testing helper that lets you store expected
values ("snapshots") directly inside your source code instead of
in external files.

During a test run, the library captures the actual output of an
expression, converts it to a reproducible repr(), and compares it
to the inline snapshot.  If they differ, it can automatically update
the snapshot in place.

This makes snapshot testing simpler for small values or codebases
that prefer keeping expectations close to the tests themselves,
without managing separate golden files.
